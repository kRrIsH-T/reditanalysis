      "My sister (Sue) lives in Austin, TX. I live with my boyfriend (Rob) about 45 minutes outside of Austin. I've been with him for over two years now. I love him, he's been so good for me. He's very kind to the people he cares about. He's very supportive. He's also a big softie. The problem is that I'm one of like 5 people that know this, because he's very introverted. If you don't know him, he comes of as aloof, even hostile. He's also much more conservative than myself and my circle of friends. This hasn't been much of an issue except with my sister. She's very liberal and very passionate about politics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rob avoids Sue whenever he can help it. When we're going out, or she's coming over, he tries not to interact with her. They've had heated arguments in the past. Well, Sue always get heated. Rob doesn't really raise his voice or get mad when he argues. But he has this tendency to calmly talk to you like you're a child, if he's arguing with you. It drives Sue crazy and she's yelled at him before and called him horrible names. One of the big things they clashed about is homelessness. It's a big thing in Austin and one of the many reasons, Rob bought a house well outside the city. Sue is very passionate about homelessness, she constantly talks about buying them food, or donating clothes and hygiene products. She talks about raising taxes and housing first policy. Like I said, she's really passionate. Rob is very much against raising taxes or giving people free stuff. He also thinks most houseless people are that way because of other factors, like addiction and mental illness, and giving them free stuff, no questions asked won't solve anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is relevant, because yesterday, Sue showed up at our door crying. One of the regular houseless people that she helps assaulted and robbed her. She knew him by name and always brought him soap, clothes and money. Rob was home. While I comforted her, he made us drinks and ordered food. He didn't say anything to her, but after a while Sue kind of blurted out, I bet you can't wait to say I told you so. Rob said not really and said she was being na√Øve and silly the whole time, there's no need to gloat. He said this in that monotone, matter of fact way like he was telling a child for the fifth time that 1+1 is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to try to write exactly what was said, as accurately as I can recall, because I still don't know how to feel. Sue started sobbing, saying why was he being an asshole, even after she admitted he was right. Rob said she didn't actually admit anything, the only reason she changed her mind was because it happened to her. It could have happened to 1000 other people and she would have not cared, still be smarmy and condescending to everyone, act superior and call people names. Then he got up to leave. Said she could stay over if she needed and left. Sue started crying again, and was mad at me for not defending her and calling Rob an asshole. I pointed out that she called him a Nazi on multiple occasions, she can't really expect him to be sympathetic to her. She then got mad at me and we argued. She would have left, if she hadn't had a few drinks. So she stayed over and left this morning. Still mad at me, still not talking. So now, I don't know if I'm in the wrong for not sticking up for Sue. AITAH here?\n",

      "I made a throwaway because I really do not want this post on my main account. \n",

      "My (35M) wife (32F) and I have been married for 5 years, together for 8. We have had a very authentic relationship all these years. Lately, my wife started complaining that I neglect her a lot, some of it is true since I have just started a family business with my friend and I used to spend a lot more energy in starting from scratch. I know this has been the case since 6 months or so, and honestly I thought my wife would support me, and understand why I do not have the energy to plan surprises for her. She is the kind of woman who expects pampering and tending, sadly I haven't been able to express the love she so craved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing, my wife has a health condition that makes it very difficult for her to get pregnant. Having kids has always been her biggest dream, and she wanted to try a year into our marriage, and even considered IVF at some point, but then our insurance did not cover it and we thought of saving up. She constantly cried to me and got emotional when her sisters and friends got pregnant and how she didn't \"score a home run\" when she came down to visit our parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that's out of the way, I had a sixth sense telling me something felt off in the few months or so. She would stay uncharacteristically busy and all that - obviously she was cheating on me with someone she met on Tinder. She confessed to me on her own and said she would do whatever it takes to repair our marriage. I was disgusted by her lack of resilience in our tough times and shamed her for her infidelity, and I'll be honest I called her a lot of names I would never dream to a person I supposedly love. However, after a few weeks of silent treatment on my end, I agreed to therapy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, we found out that she was pregnant. Her first reaction - she came running gleefully from the bathroom and announced that we are expecting a 'miracle'. She looked so energetic and full of baby fever - but I was not too thrilled. However, my wife said she never did intercourse with the AP so this baby was ours, and the paternity test which my wife obliged too also proved the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I was not on the same page as her, and told her that our marriage is hanging on by a thread and we are not ready to be parents yet. She pleaded with me to keep it, that this is our baby, already her chances of conceiving are slim and all that shit. I was still not over her cheating and gave her an ultimatum - if she wants our relationship back, she has to first prioritise it, babies can happen later. She tried to change my mind as best as I would allow her, but had to reluctantly agree. She got the abortion - even if there was a strong chance she won't be able to get pregnant again (Her doctor warned us of the possibility) \n",
      "\n",
      "My wife has been acting affectionate and we went to our first therapy a month ago. Honestly, the way my wife justified her cheating on my lack of attention in the past few months has disillusioned me from her and I feel a lot worse. I don't think I can love her the same way I did, and all I think about is her with another dude. My trust is beyond shattered. \n",
      "\n",
      "I consulted a friend who is a divorce attorney and drew up papers, and one day during dinner when she cooked something nice for us, presented it to her. She was getting an anxiety attack, her face lost colour - she started crying hysterically and demanded why I was being so cruel to her - that I took her baby and was now going to leave her destitute (prenup will ensure this), with little hope she would never get to rear a sweet baby again. She screamed and screamed until I left the house without looking back at her. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "I know having a child was her dream, but I honestly did not know if aborting our child will hurt or help - it hurt, did not change anything. Maybe a part of me was trying to wash my hands off her - because I could not even imagine co-parenting with her or be on the hook for child support for a woman who was so mentally weak.   \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: A redditor said something quite insightful to me. I couldn‚Äôt put a finger on it until they pointed it out. Yes, she had sex with me during the time she was cheating on me. This is also a violation of my informed consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I knew in that moment what she was doing behind my back, I would‚Äôve never been intimate with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: I am getting a lot of negative feedback here, which I know a partially deserve. I did something rather cruel to her, but I LOVED this woman, and I gave her a chance. But that therapy session made me feel awful. It was the lack of accountability on her part, I felt - and I admit I am doing some BS mental gymnastics about informed consent and all that.\n",
      "\n",
      "All I know is I am hurting and still sort of wish I get the woman of my dreams (her) I met when I was in my twenties. I just came here to vent and get some validation. I am going to get therapy to work through the guilt of the pain I caused her and see if I can at least start somewhere in terms of forgiving myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know when my anger wears off, I am going to feel utterly devastating-level of guilt for what I did to my wife. It‚Äôs starting to kick in. I just hope it doesn‚Äôt take my life away. \n",
      "\n",
      "So i (34F) and my husband(35M) always had a good relationship, we met at an country club and I knew he was the one, it was love at first sight. We have been married for 12 years and they‚Äôve been wonderful, but I don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore. We are pretty well of financially and he takes care of the money so I never noticed it decreasing. Two years ago my oldest child (10M) got sick and was put in the hospital, it devastated our family especially our daughter (8F) since they are were close.\n",
      "\n",
      "On to the problem, I noticed how my son Luke (fake name) haven‚Äôt gotten any better. He can barely stand up anymore and just lays in his room all day, before he was as giddy as ever. I talked to my husband today and I was shocked when he told me we couldn‚Äôt afford Luke‚Äôs medication. I screamed at him asking were the money went, he looked down in shame and said he accidentally spent it all on slots at the nearby casino with his friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "This wasn‚Äôt my proudest moment but I just lost it and I started screaming at him. Calling him useless and a good for nothing dad, he was quiet during the fiasco and just stood there. I became even more mad and slapped him across his face, After that he just left. \n",
      "\n",
      "After he left I broke down, my husband was the breadwinner and I had no idea how I was gonna pay for Luke‚Äôs medication. His parents later called and chewed me out calling me an asshole and that I was overreacting over it. \n",
      "\n",
      "So AITAH?\n",

      "\n",
      "I just want to rip the bandaid off: I (40F) cheated on my husband (42M).\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband is an architectural project manager and he likes to make a big deal of the fact that his $125k salary means that his bosses feel that they \" own him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been a disconnect between us for a long time where I feel like he over lionizes his own state of being, always making me think that the things he endures at work makes him deserve a special sense of appreciation. It's one thing to want respect , but I think in the past few years he's gotten bitter and very philosophical about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example is he always gets upset about work politics, and says I do not understand the strain of it. Yes, I do not deal with contractors, building owners, etc, but I have been putting myself through esthetician school and have had my fair share of classmate drama. At the end of the day, as long as a line isn't crossed, there's no harm, no foul, and I kept telling my husband to let it be water under the bridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband was often working until 9:30PM, and I did not understand why he couldn't delegate responsibilities. I was thinking of homeschooling our kids ( 4F, 3M) so I wanted to take this final year to be mentored by somebody who worked in a spa at a five star hotel in Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the hotel, I met \" Jacob.\" He (45M) was a traveling businessman who lied and told me he was single and unlike my husband, he radiated happiness and fondness for others. Which I haven't seen from my husband for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife (34F) found out and left him, but not before finding my husband and telling him. Jacob said he didn't mean to string me along, but that this was not going to work out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been 6 months and my husband only now has been speaking with me, which I understand. I even submitted to a polygraph test where he asked me if I still had feelings for Jacob. I passed but he was unsatisfied because he thinks I lied on one of the baseline questions ( which I didn't.)\n",
      "\n",
      "He then during therapy demanded I sign a postnup. This hurt me because I was with him when he was a grad architecture student. He said that if I ever cheated again I waived alimony. Furthermore, if I left him within 2.5 years, I waive alimony for the first 48 of the 144 months I'm likely to get alimony in the state of MA for a 15 plus year marriage. If I left within 5 years, I waive it for the first 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds spoiled, but the bottom line is that in event of divorce, I'd be unable to homeschool our kids, even with child support without alimony. My husband had before said that even if we divorced, he wanted to give me enough to go back to school for four years if I wanted. But now that is off the table and I feel like he's punishing me and the kids due to his bitterness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him this was vindictive and to rethink it because I don't want to sign anything like that. He threatened divorce and stormed out. AITA for not doing penance in this way?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I are in our early 30s and late 20s respectively. He works from home and I'm partially working from home. We both have high sex drive and before my period, mine is off the charts. We had sex a couple hours before this happened but I got horny not so soon after, so I decided to give him a blowjob under his desk if he paused what's he doing. I asked him if he could take a break. He said he can't. It wasn't something that he couldn't do 10 minutes later and it wasn't work related. It was just a video he's editing because my dad asked him to. I even gently paused the video while it was running and asked \"Not even for 10 minutes?\" He said he can't. He wanted to send the video to my dad right away. So I got a bit upset and waited for him to finish his work.\n",
      "\n",
      " After he finished, he realized I was upset and asked why. I told him I was going to give him a blowjob but he killed my mood. He was visibly regretful and asked why I didn't tell him, he would stop his work immediately. I didn't verbally explained what I had on mind, but I was naked except for a sexy bralet. I even rubbed his thighs for a bit. Also it isn't the first time I'm doing this, I like surprising him this way. I asked him to pause his work so that I could build tension, trigger his curiosity but he simply wasn't interested. Mind you, I've done this succesfully before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he playfully pushed my head down a little but I said no, I didn't want to do that anymore. He said he thought I was gonna show him our cat or an instagram post. He thought I was almost naked because it was so hot. I think if he can't take a break for me, he can't take a break for a blowjob either. After seeing him regretful and sad, I considered doing it anyway but I wouldn't enjoy it and it would be out of pity. So I told him I'd do it another time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He didn't call me an AH or anything but I wonder if I am. AITA?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: Okay, I believe I used the wrong words. I was upset means I only frowned, had a sad look on my face and he asked why. I explained. I didn't throw a tantrum, I didn't yell or anything out of line. I just told him I was going to give him a BJ. I wondered if I shouldve kept it for myself and give another reason so that he doesn't feel bad, but I kind of just blurted out. He felt bad. He said aww man im so dumb and apologized, I accepted and told him we would do it another time. Now we're fooling around in Ikea and having fun. Just a bump in the road -or not even that- indeed.\n",

I have to admit then i got furious and said some things I regret saying (Namecalling etc.) and told her to leave my house (her parents live 10 minutes away). I feel like i've been manipulated and that i've been keeping to myself for nothing (we had been dating for 7 months before we married). When she returned the day after I asked her what her real body count was and she told me it was with me included 17, To which she added that most of those were only a 1 time thing and nothing felt more like real love then with me. I told her that she had a month to pack her stuff and we are getting a divorce (thankfully we signed a strong prenup that stated that in any divorce no matter the reason our assets would not be divided, she agreed because she is the only grandchild of very very rich grandparents). My friends and her family have been blowing me up saying that this is no reason to divorce since it has nothing to do with our relationship or marriage, but i disagree if i knew she didn't have her v-card i would have never married her.\n",

If she married and divorced all 16 of those guys that'd would have been fine. (Although if u had 16 different divorces, i'd prob not be the 17th guy to marry u)\n",

      "Our normal pediatricians office is currently trying to find a doctor for my daughter to go under so until then, we have had to go to the pediatricians office in the hospital that we gave birth at. It's a training hospital so we never get the same doctor/nurse and for the last 3 appointments, these nurses have made it all about my husband. Like only checking the babies weight and for the next 45 minutes talking to him about men's mental health and asking him how he's doing since the baby arrived while me and the baby sit awkwardly in the corner of the room not being acknowledged. Or if I asked a question she would look at my husband and answer. Asking him if he's getting enough sleep. How being a new dad feels, etc while only spending 10 minutes at most with the baby and checking her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our last appointment was yesterday. We had to bring my 7yo son because he had no school. We show up and the new doctor was all \"dad do this\", \"dad do that\" and kept asking me to move out of the way. My son went over the hold his sister's hand and the nurse looks at ME and says \"next time maybe stay with the other child at home so there are no distractions\". My husband steps in and says \"I would actually have to stay home because she breast feeds the baby and I wanted to be here\". She then looks at me and says \"you could have maybe pumped? You are pumping so dad can bond with baby, right?\" I'm seething at this point but I ignore it. But then she starts talking to my husband about his business and asking him to come to her place and quote her on a job and then tries ending the appointment without even giving my daughter her 2 months shots. So I step in and say \"what about her shots\" and she's like \"oh sorry, be right back\" and then tells my husband to take the baby from me and hold her while shots are being given. I am already pissed at this point and say \"nope, I'm actually holding her so why don't you stop focusing on my husband and start focusing on the baby\". At that point she just stopped talking, did her job and left. I asked my husband to just not come anymore until we go to our normal pediatrician because I'm tired of being in these appointments for 1hr+ when we should only be there a half hour, all because these doctors find him so interesting. He says I'm an AH for asking that of him because it's not his fault.\n",

She has time to take care of all the chores, errands, bills etc. during the day. We aren't scrambling to do those tasks after work now. We have our weekends free to do things we enjoy and our evenings are calmer. I do give her a break with our sons when I'm done work (I mostly work from home, whereas my wife's job can't be done at home) and my sons are always calmer because my wife is calmer. It will definitely be an adjustment without her income but I think we can make it work.

Because $181 isn't that much. On top of that she says she wants to work. I think giving up a few luxuries or living on a small budget is worth it for her to keep staying home. I've suggested a compromise that she return to work part-time when our youngest son starts school working a few hours a week if she wants. She doesn't agree though.\n",

My daughter meant that women using epidural are risking a lot to avoid something that natural women have done all ages. DIL scoffed and said my daughter was being judgmental and that women should choose whatever method they feel without some feeling superior because choosing pain doesn‚Äôt equal more love for the baby and she laughed at my daughter and called her ridiculous when my daughter said that yes, you bond more with your baby if you understand the effort it taken to give birth. I got upset and told her if she wanted to take the easy way and use epidural, she should think of the consequences. \n",

We had a child together, although i didn‚Äôt want children as i didn‚Äôt want to not be alienated should we split, or my child to grow up in a ‚Äúbroken‚Äù home.. I bought us a house with my inheritance, spent all of it buying and renovating the house myself. \n",

      "Once my son was 2, my ex (current partner at the time) started cheating with someone older than her dad (lol) and promptly left me. 6 months after that she got solicitors involved and claimed i was abusive (i never was, and in fact have videos of her punching me in my sleep), and stopped my contact with my child. 2 years and ¬£40,000 in family court, the court offered my to write my son 4 letters a year with no contact (if you know the UK family law system, you‚Äôll understand this.

I had no idea as he and his dad especially were very involved with the church and in many instances he had been one of the men pulling in cheating men and women to meetings, and questioning them. He never concealed his disgust for those people long after those incidents happened, shunning them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way I found out about his infidelity was nothing short of traumatizing and this is where my SIL comes in. In around April of 2023, I was told by my MIL and FIL that my SIL (27F) was betraying her late husband's memory by being a stripper.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that she was obviously dancing for married men and probably sleeping with them, that this breaks every moral they raised her with.

      "\n",
      "My husband said he'd be upset if I talked to her, so I complied to make my family happy. The family kept it from being public and I guess my SIL stopped doing it for a while before finances required her to go back to \" work.\" The family did not pay her to stay quiet but threatened that she wouldn't get a job anywhere in this state or the next if she told.\n",
      "\n",
      "She decided to tell anyway, and also revealed that the family found out because my husband was dating a stripper/ escort. Even though they both were in an area pretty far from our house, their circles collided apparently and that's how my SIL was exposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband had apparently dumped the escort (24F) but was still seeing others casually so between pictures, screenshots, and some paper trail slip ups, I couldn't deny it.\n",

      "My SIL reached out to me, offering her sympathies and saying her parents threatened and basically exiled her to keep her from ratting out her brother. However, I was angry with her as well because by being loud about it, some higher authorities found out and I was forced to talk to them about it. Instead of dealing with my marriage, I first had to agree not to leave my husband, or else we both risked being booted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I agreed, attention has died down and people still do business with him, invite us to social events ( though I feel like it's more to do with the amount he pays out of his earnings more than respect now). However, my SIL thought we could be friends again. However, I think she is triggering because she is the exact type that my husband cheated with. My husband ( who I still love) doesn't want to talk to her, so I don't understand why I should make my life more difficult when my SIL was likely sleeping with married people too.\n",

      "Growing up, she was very resentful and bitter.  Between the two of us, I was the one who was more conventionally attractive and I‚Äôm more outgoing than she is, which always made me more popular in high school and college, especially with guys, and she‚Äôs always hated me for it. Lilly is one of those girls thinks that she‚Äôs better than everyone because she doesn‚Äôt wear makeup or like traditionally girly things ‚Äî you know the type. It was never fair because Lilly would never try to make herself look more attractive, just go out in shapeless clothes and no make up, and then get mad when I‚Äôd get attention, because I actually put effort into my appearance. She is also very judgmental of my clothes and behavior, would take every opportunity to slutshame me for my choices in who I dated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, Lilly graduated from school in May and got a decent job, but she asked if she could stay with me and my husband for a while, just to save money (or so she said) and keep bills low until she can afford a better apartment. I agreed to let her stay with us until the end of the year, but I‚Äôm seriously regretting it now. She‚Äôs developed a crush on my husband can‚Äôt stop trying to get attention. Before, Lilly would wear sweats around the house, never put on make up, and would never show her body. Now that she‚Äôs around my husband, she‚Äôs done a complete 180 ‚Äî she‚Äôs sleeping in basically lingerie and will wear her skimpy outfits downstairs in front of him to try and get his attention. Lilly has also started wearing makeup, even when she‚Äôs just hanging around the house, so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs going out, she‚Äôs doing it only because she‚Äôs going to be around my husband. She‚Äôs always hanging around him, trying to spend time with him, trying to butt into our personal time together. I‚Äôm not actually worried about my husband having feelings for her ‚Äî she‚Äôs not his type at ALL, but Lilly has been seriously going overboard with how hard she‚Äôs trying to get his attention and I‚Äôm getting so annoyed. I‚Äôve mentioned her behavior a couple of times, but Lilly just waves me off and pretends like she‚Äôs not doing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week we had a party where a bunch of our friends came over to watch football and Lilly was there. Now, in the past, Lily would have probably worn some kind of baggy sports t shirt (cause she just has to show that she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù), but she ended up coming downstairs in a tiny red dress that basically had her tits hanging out and a face full of makeup. Lilly looked ridiculous and I was so embarrassed because it was obvious that she was trying so hard. I overheard one of our friends, Mary, telling her how great she looked and I was so annoyed that Lilly has gotten to this point that I cut in and pointed out that her dress was a little too much and that there isn‚Äôt a reason for her to try so hard because there aren‚Äôt any guys at the party who‚Äôd be interested in her ‚Äî it was true, most of them had happily married, my husband included. Lilly got mad and ran upstairs to throw a tantrum, the way she always does when she gets called out for being a pickme, but Mary got mad at me and called me an asshole. No one else was around, so no one even heard the exchange, it‚Äôs not like I exposed Lilly behavior to the entire room, I just reminded her that she was being ridiculous by trying too hard. I told Mary about Lily‚Äôs behavior around my husband and that the realty check was one that has been needed for a while. But Mary is still calling me an asshole and telling some of our other friends about it, but painting the exchange \n",

However, it's important to note that she has evolved over the years. She invests a significant amount of time and money into skincare, facials, and luxury brands. She enjoys enhancing her appearance, and I support her in that. In fact, I have personally gifted her various items related to her interests. It's essential to understand that I love her for who she is as a person. The Reddit post merely touched upon three aspects of her identity, but she is so much more than those specific qualities.\n",

Growing up, I witnessed the instability of my parents' relationship, which has undoubtedly influenced my perspective. While she is not my first girlfriend, she is the one with whom I have had a long-lasting relationship. I recognize that these factors do not excuse my feelings or actions, but they serve as an explanation for my emotional state. In response to the numerous comments requesting it, I have been seeking therapy for a while but I‚Äôve been putting it off. I‚Äôll try to look into it properly now to address and work through these issues.\n",

Despite this, we have managed to navigate our interactions fairly well.\n",

I was disturbed for sure and told her not to joke about stuff like this. Then she, with a smile on her face, said she wasn't joking and I've been caressing a man's leg for the past minutes. She literally killed my libido at that moment. I got turned off immediately. After that day, both face to face and through texts, I tried to make her confess and assure me it was a joke. I was willing to trust her regardless and take her word for it. However she insistently kept saying \"I am a boy, I'm not kidding\". I just wanted her to say the opposite even once and relieve my mind. Instead, she decided to keep the unfunny joke going. It felt like she's been avoiding to lie about it and tell the truth by making it sound like a joke. \n",

Do I even look like a man?\" were her words. I got a little embarassed, realising she has felt mine lol. Anyway, after hearing her admission, I didn't talk about it again. Until present.\n",

      "A few days ago, when we got intimate, she said \"I never thought it would feel so good to get fucked\" during moaning. I got a little confused and didn't know what to think. Decided to keep going and talk to her about it afterwards. After finishing, I asked her what she meant by that and brought her behaviour at the beginning of our relationship up. I was expressing how it made me feel when these 2 events got connected. Then, I looked at her. She was holding her tears back. We both remained silent for a moment. Then, I told her to let it out. She started crying in my arms. I was speechless, had literally nothing to say. I've been looking complete dead at the void without any coherent thought in my mind. I was also caressing and kissing her hair to calm her down. She then asked me if she looked like a man. I replied \"no\". This time she asked if she behaves like a man. I replied \"partly\". She started crying even louder for solid 20 minutes. Complained about how everyone has been telling her that her behaviours are manlike. And said \"I wanna be girlish too\" in a crying voice. She also expressed that she was born a girl. \n",

      "Apparently, me thinking she's originally a boy made her really upset. On the other hand, she's responsible for this. It isn't even about her looking/behaving like the other gender. You often can't tell if a person has changed their gender before. I'm taking her word for it. Therefore she should've stopped joking about something like this as soon as I told her to. We've shared a lot in the past 5 months. We really love each other and I trust her with my heart. I don't consider a breakup or anything. It would be deal breaker if she really was a MTF transgender woman. But I'm currently convinced by her confession. What do you  think?\n",

So the day of the reunion comes, my boyfriend and I drove a long drive there. When we came everyone was excited to see me except my sister only because she wasn't getting the attention. So everyone sat down and wanted me to talk about how I was doing in life. I looked over to see my sister with her arms cross and just pouting like a toddler. After, everyone was done talking we decided to eat. After everyone has sat down and started eating my boyfriend and I had announced we were having a baby. A few people congratulated me and the rest just sat there quiet. Then I look at my sister and she just had tears in her eyes. Then my sister got up and ran upstairs. My mom an dad ran after her. Then it just became quiet, after 20 minutes of everyone eating in silence, I decided to make everyone leave. \n",

Well a couple of weeks into the relationship, she wanted to start hitting the gym to lose some weight and gain a bit of muscle, I asked why she wanted to hit the gym, and she said because she‚Äôs never been comfortable with her body and that she got inspired by this fitness woman she follows on instagram, I told her that she looks fine the way she is but I told her to do it if she wants to, but I really didn‚Äôt want her too but it‚Äôs her body, her choice. Fast forward a year later, she lost about 20 pounds but went up to 119 pounds because of her muscle gain. I‚Äôm proud of her, but a part of me is a bit ashamed to admit to her that I prefer how she looked like when we started dating. Every time we tried doing the deed with her current physique I had to use viagra, I tried and I just couldn‚Äôt without it, I went to the doc for a check up and came out good. Yesterday she wanted to do it so I obliged, and of course I struggled, we hadn‚Äôt tried in a while due to work, and she thought since we hadn‚Äôt seen each other that I‚Äôd finally be able to, but that didn‚Äôt happen. She asked what was wrong, and I decided to come out clean. I told her that I don‚Äôt find her attractive anymore, and that I miss her old body, she got upset and told me that I‚Äôm just jealous that she‚Äôs more dedicated to working out than I ever was and that she‚Äôs showing more results than I ever did. Anyways she told me she isn‚Äôt planning on going back to her old physique and that if I don‚Äôt like her now then I have to get used to it if I want to be with her. We haven‚Äôt spoke since.

I know it sounds terrible, but I can't help how I feel. I can't shake the feeling that this can't be it. D works from home, which allowed me flexibility to go back to work part time. I get up, make everyone breakfast, take the oldest son to school and go to work. One of our parents comes over to watch the kids. D picks up our son from school and when I get home, we eat, have family time. Rinse, repeat. We are lucky that both of our parents live relatively close, and someone is always available to watch the grandkids. It also allows us to have a date night on Friday night.\n",

They adore her. Fight over which one of them gets to be pushed in the pool by her. They all collapse on top of each other on daddy's lap and watch sports. It warms my heart whenever I see them. Whenever I join them, D throws his arm around be and it's just melts me every time.

My mind has started to wander. I know how wrong it is, and whenever I'm driving back from work or with my family I feel disgusted at myself for even entertaining the thought. But whenever I see him, it goes right out the window. I'm finding myself spending more time at work and I'm afraid I'm going to make a mistake and risk ruining my family.

I felt so bad for but it doesn‚Äôt mean she can get jealous for me having kids? A few months after that incident was  the baby shower and I invited everyone. Including Katelyn. When she arrived she seemed happy and I tried to believe she was being kind for once in her Life but no I was wrong. We all went outside and did a countdown from 10 and Me and my husband  popped the ballon! We were having a baby boy! I was so happy .while everyone was congratulating us she went over to the food section and completely trashed it. Throwing and tossing food and desserts everywhere. I was absolutely furious. I told all the guests  to leave and had A COMPLETE FIT and Katelyn . Screaming and tossing stuff she was also yelling at me , she tried to grab my hair but lucky for her mum pulled us apart . I told her to get the fuck out of my house and she left. The next day Katelyn came back to the house and apologised.I forgived her as I didn‚Äôt want to hold grudges, I want a nice environment for my new baby boy to live in. It was the day of my due date and my water broke. My husband rushed me to the hospital and turns out I had a pair of twins. I was over the moon with happiness. So was my husband . My sister came over to congratulate me and I was happy that she was happy for me:). A week later I returned home and went to bed . The next day. Katelyn came to me and my husband and gave us breakfast in bed. I thought it was weird but I thought maybe she was just happy for us. Later on that day she asked to speak to me privately. She took me to our living room and said ‚ÄúI know we have had our bad days but you know I love you so much and I would do anything for you and you would do the same? This might seem like a big favour but can I have one of you babies . You know I can‚Äôt have babies and if you did this for me I Would always treasure it. I stood up in disbelief , I felt as if a bullet had been shoot right through my heart.What kind of silly question is that Katelyn? I asked , she then said  I know It‚Äôs a big deal but I‚Äôm your little sister and it would be a dream come true if you let me ha- NO I said with a firm voice interrupting her. Don‚Äôt ask me such a stupid question. She r ose slowly from her seat with tears forming in her eyes . No? She questioned‚Ä¶.. I thought you were my sister and that you loved me but I guess I was wrong. I do love you but you know it‚Äôs always been my dream to have twins and it you were a real sister you wouldn‚Äôt want to take that away from me. BUT I WANT A CHILD THATS MY OWN BLOOD she then yelled at me. I told her to quiet down as the kids were sleeping. She apologised and agreed to quiet down . The she then continued to debate with me in taking MY OWN child. I told her to leave as my answer was not changing she said if you don‚Äôt give me the baby I‚Äôm going to ‚Äúhurt myself‚Äù I told her to get the fuck out of my house before I call the cops.

This caught me off guard because, in our initial talks, she'd never mentioned this. Concerned, I asked if she'd used protection, to which she replied she couldn't recall. My stomach sank. I felt compelled to ask if he'd finished inside her. That question set her off, big time. In a raised voice, she shot back, \"I don't need to tell you that! You're asking really private things. But F.Y.I, NO, HE DIDN'T.\" Now, I was just scrambling mentally, wondering if she might've put me at risk, especially since we hadn't used protection during our first date.

The problem is what makes me very careful making long term plans with her is the sex part. She is quiet as a mouse. One of my turn ons is giving pleasure to my partner and with her I don‚Äôt get that because of how quiet she is. I have no f-ing idea when it‚Äôs good for her or when she comes. I have tried to discuss this with her and she has promised multiple times to be more vocal and sometimes I see that she remembers and moans but then falls back into her own habits.

My wedding was a beautiful summer beach wedding in Hawaii and I couldn‚Äôt wait to be married to the love of my life all my bridesmaids were there and I was about to go out but my best friend and maid of honor still wasn‚Äôt there, I stalled as long as I could (almost an hour) until she got to the venue. She claimed she got lost, I was a little suspicious but didn‚Äôt let that ruin my big day. She was still in her pjs and said she had to go change. We waited another 5 minutes until she came out into the room in a wedding gown veil and all. I was furious I kicked her out and bawled my eyes out while walking down the aisle. The rest of the night I tried to forget about it and have fun but it was always in the back of my mind no matter how many drinks I had. A month goes by and she finally apologized, I forgave her but not fully. That‚Äôs when I had a plan, her wedding was In a few months and I wanted to give her a taste of her own medicine. I arrived to the wedding a hour late still in my pjs and then after I got dressed I came out in the same dress and veil she wore at my wedding.

Not knowing anyone at the wedding, I gravitated toward a bridesmaid (30-ish F), I guess because she looked familiar or whatever. I danced next to her in the line dance, and when the song was over we just started dancing together. She had great rhythm and it was fun. She was a bit tipsy and was kind of flirty, but to me it was just dancing. We danced several more times in the night (no slow dancing, obviously).\n",

      "I told her that I like to dance, and that I need someone with a similar skill level if I'm going to be comfortable doing it in public when I don't know people. I know that was kind of mean to say, but it is the truth. I also figured it would eliminate the whole flirting thing even if it still hurt her feelings. She doubled-down and said it sounds like I wanted the bridesmaid **because** she is such a good dancer. I admitted that I am attracted to good dancers because who isn't, but that wasn't a deal-breaker for me and my girlfriend and I would have never made a move on the bridesmaid. It was just dancing. Apparently even a couple of her nosy friends commented on it. I guess the bridesmaid is known for being a bit of a promiscuous person, but I wasn't into her.\n",

However, although my parents never treated him any differently because of it, they were devoutly religious people and believed his lifestyle to be fundamentally immoral. They told me in private that they would literally pray for him to become heterosexual. I share their faith, but I'm not nearly as fervent about it, and I'm not particularly concerned with my son's sexuality. I continue donating to the same small church they attended their entire lives and remain active, and they themselves donated hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly into the low seven figures, over the course of their membership.\n",

He seemed surprised and asked why. I explained that the assets that I had accumulated and worked for would be shared equally between the boys, but the ones that my parents had worked for would only pass to my younger son because I believe my parents would not want to fund my elder son's lifestyle, specifically his large donations to LGBT causes.  He lives well below his means because he donates an enormous percentage of his income to these organizations. I know, in my heart of hearts, that my parents would not want to fund what they considered sin, and using the money they spent their entire lives accumulating in order to better our family to do so makes me feel like I'd be spitting on their graves.\n",

I believe I'm doing the right thing to honor my parents and their legacy, but my wife and other son both thing that since they've passed, their wishes shouldn't matter.\n",

I never knew he did that and if I did, I would‚Äôve never gotten back with him. The age difference honestly grosses me out and he knows that about me. They never did anything but when he told me I just told him that grossed me out and when I was 23 I never looked at 19 year olds like that. So when he told me he did that, I broke up with him because that crossed a line with me. He says I‚Äôm overreacting and I shouldn‚Äôt break up with him. AITA?\n",

      "For some backstory: me (32f) and my four siblings (38m, 35m, 30f and 28f) grew up with very strict parents that expected the most out of us. They wanted us to do the best in school and our extracurriculars, so we could go to the best colleges when we graduated. Four of us were able to respect all the rules and live up to our parents' standards. My sister Heather (28) could not. \n",
      "\n",
      "Heather always had a hard time getting her grades up passed a C+. She was smart, but academically she was far behind the rest of us which often got her into trouble. With her grades so low, she was often unable to have privileges the rest of us did. We all got to attend our proms and homecoming, she could not because of her grades. We got new cars after graduation, she didn't. Our parents paid for our college, but didn't do the same for her. This pushed Heather away and she stopped talking to our parents the minute she left for college. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Heather and I have kept in LC for the last few years because we never really got along as children. However, Heather and our oldest brother, Mark (38) have always gotten along. In fact, he helped her out a lot while she was in college, and she stayed with him when she lost her apartment to a fire last summer. He's really the only one who knows anything about her life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last weekend, Heather and I were out with Mark just catching up. As we were talking over lunch, Heather expressed sadness for not getting to attend her prom after hearing the stories I shared about mine. I told her that it was her fault that she didn't get to attend and if she just studied harder to get her grads up to an A, she would have been able to attend prom. She mentioned to me that it was unfair and that our parents should have just let her attend prom, since she wasn't actually failing. I snapped at her and informed her that a C just wasn't good enough to be rewarded the privilege of going to prom and maybe if she wasn't so dumb she'd be able to get A's and actually get to attend prom. She said nothing as she put cash down and quickly left the restaurant with her baby girl. Mark shook his head at me and called me an ass before also leaving. I honestly don't think I'm in the wrong, but AITAH?\n",

I pointed out that there are 9AM, 12PM, 3PM, 6PM flights, all of which are flights people aren't trying to sleep during.

So over 16 years ago when I was pregnant with Eliza my then husband Preston (41M) cheated on me with his secretary and left me as a single mother with my daughter Eliza. For a few years I had to move back in with my parents to financially support myself and my daughter but then by 12 years ago I got a new job and was able to buy a home for me and my daughter in Maine. So me and Eliza moved from New York to Maine.\n",

Charlie wasn't really a masculine teenage boy as he was very clean and had a lot of Taylor Swift music in his Playlist, he also wore a lot of pink and always cooked me and Eliza dinner when he came over to my house. At first I saw those as green flags as my ex husband was the definition of a manly man and was a total asshole and believed my daughter was much luckier with her taste in men. \n",

As far as i know D had his best friend E since he was 8 years old. My husband never had trouble with the kid or with the friendship they had, the only thing he contested was that his father is a therapist (he‚Äôs kind of a conservative, i have to say i never liked this side of him) but other than that he never had any problem with his son being around D. Recently though he had been acting strange with the kid, i don‚Äôt know exactly why but he‚Äôs been hostile with him and i heard him telling D to stay away from E. At first i thought it was because of the therapist thing and didn‚Äôt go deeper in the argument. \n",

The problem was he only told me he was going and not my husband, he got really mad and went to check up on him. I don‚Äôt know what happened there but my husband was livid when he returned home and didn‚Äôt want to talk about it so i let go again. \n",

      "I visited him and his ex wife, which is also my friend, explained the situation to me, i hugged the kid and promised him i‚Äôd bring the cheesecake tomorrow. He‚Äôs a really good kid, he‚Äôs spontaneous and joyful but when i looked at him in the eyes in that moment he was so tired and drained that i wonder if he abused him in the past when i wasn‚Äôt at home.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, my brain is saying i should leave him and what he did it‚Äôs not acceptable in any case but my heart is saying i love him too much to leave him like this. I wonder if we had a child togheter and that child turns out to be gay, would he do the same? \n",
      "For now i‚Äôm not talking to him and i made sure he knows i‚Äôm not ok with the thing he did and i explicitly told him that i support their relationship. \n",

I was going to use tax money to pay her back , but my fianc√© got into a car accident with our daughter.She‚Äôs ok ,but  she had to take sometime off work. She‚Äôs been depressed and stressing about bills so I got her her official engagement ring to help her mood.  I told my ‚Äúex best friend ‚Äú and she got mad saying trying to call me out for not paying her back. I feel like she knows the struggle we been through and if she was a real friend she would of been happy for me.

      "Now there was nothing wrong with his place he had a nice spacious apartment clean floors, done dishes, no visible trash, everything was great.

We watched TV for a little bit then moved to his room, He couldn't stop lamenting over the fact that this would be the first time we'd have sex in his bed even talking about it at dinner. He'd had everything prepared little did I know he had led lights to \"set the mood\" and music that came from said Google home. I asked we could do without the music but he pleaded with me to keep it. I gave in and we got back to it stressed me out so again I asked to stop the music. He said if it's really that bad ok. Again we got back to it but with the fact that we weren't exactly quiet and it was just sitting there I got tense and this time asked if we could just move the device to another room. When he asked why I told him my concerns and he almost laughed and just told me I'm doing to much and to chill out. Which hurt, at this point I can't even focus on sex and demands he get rid of it. He's taken aback and is on the verge of tears when I make him pick between the thing or me. \n",

Thought I, who graduated only a few months before Covid hit was holding her back. After 2.5 months of being single and a very bad date or three (one of them has attempted SA), she asked for me to get back together with her. I had one rebound with an old college fling. But I had nothing serios going on, so i told her she needs to build back the trust i felt she had broken but i would think it over. About 2.5 months later i took her back.

My gf on the otherhand was already heavy when i got with her, during the first part of our relationship i actually helped her loose weight by cooking myself and portion controling both of us. Which she actively asked me to do. During our break she put back on all the pounds we lost before. She is 5‚Äô3, and her starting weight when we got back together was 280ish, and she is 320lbs now.

My wife found out I downloaded their conversation, and she told me I violated her privacy. She said it feels like I read through her diary.

      "My (41m) wife (44f) slept with a close friend of ours, 20 years ago.  I found out about it through an email, not directly from her.  I'm angry enough about this that I don't want to envision a \"rest of my life\" situation with her, and have asked for a divorce.  Here's why (and some other important points):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. She'd broken up with me, at the time.  We got back together about a year later, and had both been with other people, but she was with this guy a few weeks after she'd left me.\n",
      "2. The guy is the brother of my closest friend.  I don't know exactly why that bothers me, but it does.\n",
      "3. He'd hit on her previously, and she didn't tell me.  When I confront her about that, she says, \"I didn't realize he was hitting on me.\" That's not even remotely possible: I saw emails from him to her with him telling her how cute she was and that they should hang out sometime. He knew the two of us were in a relationship, and she saved these emails and never told me about them.\n",
      "4. She was acting flirty / interested throught the whole time we knew him. She completely denies this, but I know what I saw.\n",
      "5. She emailed her friend, after they hooked up, talking about how jealous she was of him and his new girlfriend.\n",
      "6. She (still) claims that all that happened between the two of them was him attempting a kiss, and then her shutting it down. We weren't 12, that's not what happens with two horny adults. I feel like she's insulting my intelligence. Also, I swear that the details of this story have changed over time. Once it was that they \"fooled around,\" next it was that they \"made out,\" now it's \"I was trashed, and he tried to kiss me.\"  She swears the story has been consistent over time.\n",
      "7. I called the dude a little over a year ago (edited for clarity) to confront him. He told me it happened more than once, but that they never had sex.  She swears it was only once, and he's backtracked and says he has a \"bad memory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we got back together, she's been entirely faithful, to the best of my knowledge. I have no reason to doubt that she's completely committed...now. But I have no interest growing old as a second choice, and that's how I feel. She says I've always been her first choice, and that I'm an AH for wanting to break up a family (we have 2 kids) over a drunken minor indiscretion, that she didn't even engage with, 20 years ago, while we were already split (note: she did the splitting). No one has been able to tell me clearly whether I'm the AH, so internet, AITAH?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: wow, you all are wild.  I didn't expect so many comments, and can't respond to all of them, so I'll try to clarify a bit here:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Yes, we both slept with other people. No, I don't care that she slept with other people. This isn't about cheating, because this wasn't cheating. I tried to make that clear with the quotation marks in the title, but Reddit doesn't really do nuance or reading comp, huh?  I care because this was a many years long crush she had prior to the break up, and it seems very apparently she left me to shoot her shot with this guy, and got turned down, then came back.  Again, it doesn't mean she violated some moral principle or weird dating rule, but I'm not obligated to accept second place, either, I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Had she told me about it when it happened, it would've changed my calculus on whether or not to get back together. I honestly have no idea what decision I would've made, because I wasn't given that choice, but it definitely would have been a factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If she had told me a year ago, instead of me finding out on my own, I'd be pissed, but would've gotten over it pretty quick. As you all seem to be super into pointing out, it was 20 years ago, and we are different people now.  But trust is trust, and I'm suspicious because she never told me, and even after me finding out, I've gotten vague and conflicting stories from her, which also conflict with what he told me. If this was so minor, why bother lying about it at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Someone mentioned SA, and I said she hinted at it. For clarity, what she said was that she was so drunk, she doesn't even know what happened, or if she could even have consented. This came up after the vague and conflicting stories I mentioned, and it feels like an excuse. Nevertheless, I guess it could be SA, in which case, fuck that guy sideways (much more so than I already think he ought to be fucked sideways).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. No, there's no one I'm interested in at work, at the gym, at the coffee shop (?), or anywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Is this a midlife crisis?  I don't know, maybe? Never had one of those before.  I haven't bought a Porsche, though, so maybe that's a good sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. No, this wasn't a first relationship for either of us, we'd both been with a few people before we met (and during the break up, for that matter). We were young, but not that young.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I got most of the stuff folks seem confused about.  I don't expect anyone to flop to NTA / ESH over this, but you folks asked (or at least angrily assumed).\n",

      "Edit (3?): I get it y'all: the vast majority of you say I'm the AH, and I'm totally onboard with that. Trolls will troll, but I'm actually only trying to respond to the folks with perspective, even though that perspective disagrees with mine. Please excuse me if I didn't respond to you, it's either because 1) there's so damn many of you!

      "So my baby daddy finally came to visit his daughters after getting a dna test proving they were in fact his babies (twins). I allowed him to stay at my house so he could save money but I was under the impression he was sleeping in the living room. The three days he actually stayed with us, he refused to sleep on the couch as in his words ‚ÄúI came to sleep in a bed‚Äù (we are not together and haven‚Äôt been since I was pregnant). we had agreed on me getting up during the night to take care of them then and he would do so during the morning, he didn‚Äôt he was basically 3rd child who cleaned up after and made him food. And the last night he was at the home and I had been up all night with the girls while he slept. In the morning (around 9-10am) I had asked him to get up and feed one of our daughters as she woke up and was crying, he refused saying he had something important to do and wasn‚Äôt going to get up now to help (the important thing was his friends dad‚Äôs attempted murder trial) cause he wanted to sleep in longer til he had to get up for that. He had ‚Äúslept in‚Äù for a whole 10 mins then got up laid in bed listening to the trial, (he wasn‚Äôt giving testimony or anything just wanted to listen). I ended up getting up with the girls and taking care of them while he listened to the trial and called his friends, after a few hours the girls had woken up again so I asked him if he could help now as the trial was over, he refused to saying he wanted to nap saying he got no sleep (I was up all night he was completely asleep snoring away) it pissed me off and I ended up getting my neighbor to come over and help while he slept and before she got there, I had gone in the room to grab the girls and turned the light before I picked them up. as I was walking out the bedroom door he asked me to turn the light off and I said no as I clearly had 2 children in my arms and couldn‚Äôt really do so (he ended up falling asleep with the light on by the time I got the girls settled so I saw no reason to go back in and turn it off) after the girls were finished eating and were falling back asleep I put them back in their bed turned the light off and decided to try to nap while they slept. As I laid down, he got up stomping out of the room turned the light on so I shut it back of not complaint then he comes stomping back in turns it on again (does this about 2 more times). I got a little sick of it and told him  ‚Äústop acting childish I only didn‚Äôt turn the light back off when you asked cuz my hands were full and I wanted to settle the girls, and by the time that was done you were already asleep‚Äù he stomps out the door slams it so hard it wake the girls back up so I never got the nap I wanted. Now he refuses to come back and see them as I am apparently ‚Äúnuts‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt want to be around me, but he is incapable of taking care of them on his own, he refuses to change their diaper as it makes him uncomfortable, doesn‚Äôt get up when they‚Äôre crying at night and doesn‚Äôt wake up for them in the morning unless i physically wake him up. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do here. (Other than going to court for complete custody as he thinks it‚Äôs his mother‚Äôs responsibility to help him change diapers and feed them) I would gladly split custody with his mother as I know they would be well taken care of (only if she wanted) but not him if he thinks it‚Äôs other people‚Äôs responsibility to take care of his children.\n",

They were saying that he knew what he was doing when he came inside her and now he needs to step up. And that I was an idiot for not understanding that.

Arguing that if the woman is not found guilty, there was no rape. If someone who is over the age of 18 has a sexual encounter with someone who is under the age of 18, and they were not in a previous relationship before the person who was over 18 turned 18 it is now statutory rape, no matter if they are found guilty or not. He is claiming that someone, who is found not guilty, did not commit the crime yet there are people in prison, who are there for crimes they cannot commit, and there are people who are not in prison, who should be because they did commit the crime, and there was just a mistrial the court of law is not 100% all the time. It is long-winded I know, but this person is pissing me the fuck off because it‚Äôs no longer a debate. It is now a topic on if someone is convicted of a crime or not whether it is OK to get child support for them no child who had sex with someone who is over the age of 18 and that they did not have a previous relationship with before the person turned 18 should be legally required to pay child support.\n",

I divorced my ex husband ( college sweetheart) after 15 years of marriage because I felt like my ex husband ultimately meant well, the New England type bluntness that I tried to excuse when we were dating translated into me not feeling supported. Only when I'd yell at him over the clinical way he viewed things would he try to make up for it by trying \" talk more Southern\" as he called it, but he'd revert back to his \" Ok, so?\" attitude shortly after. \n",

After he got off, I approached him about it, and explained how hurt I felt that he complimented the skin in a sexual manner. Initially, he was surprised, but he tried to take my feelings seriously. We talked about it, and then headed to bed on a good note, but I kept thinking about the issue. I don‚Äôt have an opinion on Nicki Minaj either way, but it felt like my husband wasn‚Äôt taking my concern seriously when he knows I have self esteem issues.

I felt like my husband was making me out to be the issue and I begged him to stop playing all together, and told him he knows my self esteem is fragile, especially since all his exes are African-American like Nicki Minaj and I‚Äôm asking one thing from him. My husband told me I am making an unreasonable request and he would not stop playing the game, and asked me to consider making an appointment with my therapist to talk about my self esteem and he offered to come with me. At this point I started crying because I felt like he was making me out to be crazy and I locked myself in our room. I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since. \n",

      "So I (29M) have been with my girlfriend (28F) for a little over a year and it has honestly been amazing. This is not my first relationship, I previously had 2 girlfriends and each lasted for longer than my current one has so far. But I honestly never knew that a relationship could be fulfilling like this and being with her has opened up a whole new side of life for me. I really never knew what love was before this, and I mean that. She's the best friend I've ever had. I am happy and I am while not so naive as to think she's prefect, there is nothing missing in this relationship for me personally.\n",

      "The thing is, I can't imagine any reason why we would ever break up. There's no reason I can think of that I wouldn't or shouldn't marry her, and that has always kind of scared me in the back of my head. I've brought up these feelings. I told her I can see marrying her and also that scares me. She was characteristically understanding. She said the prospect of forever with somebody can be scary and that makes sense. Fear is part of it. You can always talk to me about it. Etc. But this fear has never been a huge issue, just something in the back of my head like I said. We're only a year in so neither of us is talking about getting engaged in the near future, but a longterm future always felt very likely.\n",

I was helping a buddy set up a proposal for his gf and I just had this thought - \"I'm not ready for this to be it.\" I can't shake that feeling that I'm just not ready for this to be it. I can't imagine never dating again. She is amazing, but I feel like I need more data to get the to threshold of certainty I would need to marry somebody. Ironically, now that I've seen what a healthy loving relationship can be, I want to know what I would be like in other relationships. I could be blissfully happy for another few years, but just can't get to certainty without ever dating again. I feel like I'm going insane.\n",

      "A couple years back, my (36f) sister (31f) lived with us. In this specific case, she was running late to work and her car was in the shop at the time. She begged my husband (37m) to use his car but he kept denying her and telling her she's too inexperienced (she had been driving for a year and a half at the time). Well she was in a rush and she made the not-so-great decision and took his car without his consent. My husband rushed out of the door as soon as he heard the engine start but he was too late.  Well like I said, my sis was in a rush and ran a red light, causing her to get in an an accident. She apologized profusely and I barely convinced my husband to not press charges and/or take her to court. The total cost amounted to 15000 in damages they my husband has to pay for out of pocket. \n",

      "Anyways, let's get to the actual situation. We host family reunions every year at our house where both sides of our family come over to just party and catch up. My sister came (obviously) and it was pretty awkward when they were around each other. I was talking to my husband and sis about investing and when my sister chimed in about buying some apartment rooms or houses to rent out. My husband then just came in and said \"Lets hope you don't cause 15k and damages this time.\" My sister just got up and left after that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought my husband into the living room inside and told him he needed to get over whatever bs he's holding on to and I reminded him that accident happened almost 4 years ago. He then said \"Ok so right know I'll throw your shit in the trash,  and in 2027 if you're still mad, I'll bring up this exact conversation. \n",

I have never, not once, met a person who loves attention more than my daughter does and she will absolutely go out of her way to get as much attention as possible. It can get really frustrating at times. Given this information, I can't tell if I'm overreacting by kicking my GF out..\n",
      "\n",
      "So basically, my daughter will immediately tell you to watch her/listen to her the second you are doing anything productive (cooking, cleaning, making a phone call) but otherwise won't ask you to stop what you're doing, so that's annoying. Or she will purposely drool and make spit bubbles and baby talk while doing so and my GF has a spit phobia so it pisses my GF off (I've asked my daughter to stop and she will fake cry or laugh). But the big issue is food... She cannot/will not eat anything without covering her face with whatever she's eating. Anything with sauce is the worst. She will have it all over her forehead, all through her hair, all over her hands and it is on purpose because she will draw attention to it and say \"look\" with a giant smile on her face and she never gets any on her clothes. It grosses my GF out to no end and I get it but it's like.. fucking irritating that she has to call it out every single time and say \"she needs help because this attention seeking bullshit is getting out of control\" or \"that's fucking repulsive, why don't you tell her to stop?\" \n",

      "Well, I was due to pick up my daughter yesterday and my GF was asking what I wanted for dinner and I said my daughter wanted spaghetti. She goes \"I'm not making spaghetti just so she can purposely get it all over her face and say 'look ha ha ha, I'm gross'. I'd rather have a meal she can't purposely cover herself in.\" At this point I just told her to get out because I'm tired of her calling my kid gross over it. It IS gross but shut the fuck up about it. She said \"fine by me\", packed her stuff and left. My friend says I'm an AH because \"dude there truly is something wrong with your kid. She's just not afraid to call you out on it.\"\n",

She said she doesn't need it and that there's nothing wrong with our kid. She never put me on the birth certificate and I didn't know my daughter existed until she was 3. There's no custody agreement so it's not like I can just go and get her therapy myself or I would. We do have a court date set because her mom wants more child support and to go through the state but that's not until September and until the determine paternity (I have no doubt she's my kid, as she looks just like me). At that point I can get my kid in to therapy but right now I physically cannot. Her mom says she's diagnosed ADHD but she never sends meds to my house so I'm not sure what to believe.\n",

Well I know she has a fear of cars, planes, all transportation. Don‚Äôt know why and she specifically hates my driving.

We stopped for gas and she begged her mom to drive or stop me but she didn‚Äôt say anything. Once we got to where we were going she wouldn‚Äôt even look at me and has refused to ride with me since.

      "So call me all the names you want, but I‚Äôve been doing band for as long as possible. I‚Äôve always done music, and I‚Äôm talented asf. Give me any instrument and I could learn it in a week. I‚Äôm in percussion, and I‚Äôm the most advanced in my section (yes I‚Äôm bragging smd), so since it‚Äôs early on in the year we have new people in our sections. So before I get into that I need to explain how my school is. So we don‚Äôt have a middle school, so as soon as you hit 7th you‚Äôre sent to the high school. So in 7th grade our school requires you either do band, or choir, so there are usually a lot of new 7th graders who join percussion, because some of the instruments are really easy, and it‚Äôs better than singing and dancing, and we usually do give them the easier parts, because I get it, and also hate school choir.\n",

      "Anyways now getting into the actual story, so I‚Äôm going to start off the story by saying I‚Äôm gay. I highly prefer women, and the only men I am attracted to are like men from TV shows. I‚Äôve honestly never been attracted to a man I know irl before. So this is the first year this one 7th grader has done band, and he has absolutely no musical experience, so he was off the bat horrible. Our band teacher just kinda left it up to anyone in our section who‚Äôs more experienced, so I was one of the students helping him. So this whole thing mostly started by us all going over accents. He didn't know how hard to hit the drum, or how to hit it, for some of the accents, so I just did what my band teacher did, and I just grabbed onto his hand and played the accents so he could get the feel. The next morning a girl in his class who's also in band, came up to me and told me about how his girlfriend is mad about me being \"too touchy\". I just thought it was funny because I am a fruit, and a 12 year old thinks I want her boyfriend. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the weeks move on, and this 12 year old still is talking about me. Our section is pretty cramped, so to get where I need to go, I sometimes gently move people out of the way. There was a certain situation she was upset about. So her boyfriend was in my way, so I pushed his shoulder to move him, but for some reason he thought it'd be cute to just not move anyway. Now I ain't got the time for this shit yk, so I put my hand on his chest, and slammed him into a wall. I guess from her perspective it looked sexual or something? I just ignored it again, until at the end of the period, this 5'1 little girl, approaches me AND CALLS ME A WHORE AND A BITCH?!?!? Tf‚Ä¶ Now I am 14 and I am a proud ass virgin mf. Now I've kissed 20+ girlsü•∂ but that does not make me a whore.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I could have just told her I am gay, BUT AFTER THAT BS? Nah I'm gonna fuck with her. So now anytime he needs help I purposefully hold his hand, even if not 100% necessary. I'll purposefully forget some of my music, so I have to sit right next to him. And heres where I may have gone too far‚Ä¶ \n",

      "I like physical touch, so if I'm next to one of my closer friends, I'll hold their hand, or like lean on them or something. So today he asked me \"If your gay, why do you always hold hands with guys?\" I told him, and he asked if he could hold my hand. IK IM SORRY THIS IS THE MOST IMMATURE SHIT EVER BUT I HELD THAT MF HAND. Once she realized her face got red asf, than she started whispering to her friends. And that would of 100% been the end of it, IF I DIDNT HEAR THAT LITTLE BITCH CALL ME A WHORE AGAIN. So when we were reviewing shit I leaned my head on him, than a few minutes later pulled out the \"Im coldü•∫\" card and wore that 12 year olds flannel like a champ. All of my friends thought this was hilarious, but I started to feel bad when I saw her tear up. \n",

She was venting to me late one night about an 8 year old student of hers. I admit I was being short with her. She was venting about a disagreement with a teachers speedy assessment of the student, I said ‚ÄúHave you ever been a teacher, sometimes you can tell immediately.‚Äù referring to an experience I had working with a high school math student who didn‚Äôt have the multiplication or division table memorized (like 3 X 6 = 18).\n",

She called me disrespectful, insensitive, mean and disgusting for insinuating such a thing. Since then I have apologized not stop, but she always just stonewalled and after a few days of silence she informed me that she is seeking a separation. Like wtf.

      "I (28F) was asked to be the maid of honor to my best friend Jessica (27F) at her wedding. We met in high school and had gone to the same college together where I met my ex Dan (29M). A year after our breakup, he began flirting with my best friend. She asked me if it would be alright with me if she dated him and I said it was fine as what we had was in the past and we ended on good terms. Dan and Jessica soon became an on and off couple as they had many arguments and broke up frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night in college when Jessica was out getting us all tacos (all being Dan, me, Jessica, and our mutual friend Sam), Dan started talking about our relationship and what it was like in our sophomore year of high school when we dated. A few minutes into the conversation, Sam said ‚ÄúJessica isn‚Äôt going to like this.‚Äù. I brushed off what Sam said as Jessica knew that Dan and I had dated and heard me when I said that what we had was in the past. Unfortunately when Jessica found out what we had been talking about she lashed out on me and said that I had my chance with Dan and it wasn‚Äôt her fault that I blew it. I told her that she was blowing things out of proportion and that I did not have feelings for Dan and she later cooled down and apologized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years later, Jessica asked if I would be her maid of honor. I had mixed emotions. I was shocked to find out she was engaged in the first place as she revealed later on that she had kept her engagement a secret from me for a week to surprise me when she asked the question. I wanted to say yes but was skeptical as her and Dan had just gotten back together a week prior to her engagement after their nastiest and longest breakup lasting over 4 months. I said yes despite being unsure of their marriage working out and decided not to say anything as she is a very emotional person and already had the added pressure of her wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month into planning the wedding I finally released my emotions and explained to her that I didn‚Äôt think the marriage would end up working out. She lashed out on me once again and said that I didn‚Äôt have the right to question her marriage or give her advice as I am currently single. I told her that even if I weren‚Äôt single, I have experience in dating and have quite literally dated her fianc√©. She ended up ignoring what I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month before the wedding, Dan texts me and we flirt nonstop for a week. I didn‚Äôt see it as flirting at first until I slowly fell back in love with him and finally realized. I feel guilty for my feelings but tell myself that as long as I‚Äôm not acting on any urges it‚Äôs fine. It might just be sexual tension. I think this until he texts me asking if I want to Netflix and chill. I genuinely thought he just wanted to watch Netflix and chill together and I didn't know what the term meant until I got there. The worst of it all is that I didn‚Äôt stop him and it was the best sex I EVER had. We continuously chatted afterwards but I explained to him that our relationship had to stop before the wedding. He agreed and ghosted me to avoid anymore feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the wedding comes. Through the entire ceremony I feel incredibly awkward and I can see that that‚Äôs how Dan feels too. The officiator asks everyone to speak now or forever hold their peace. Something inside of me snaps. I‚Äôve known Jessica since we were freshmen, I can‚Äôt keep lying to her face. I object and explain to everyone that I still have feelings for Dan. Everyone watches me horrified. The only noise heard after I speak is a hundred people murmuring and turning to each other. This near silence is broken by Jessica with a mix of a wail and a scream. She screams at me and tells me to go to hell. She says the only reason I objected was because I have a pathetic life and can‚Äôt watch other people be happy. Finally, she tells me to kill myself because there‚Äôs no one in this world who could possibly love me, not even myself. This crushes me. My words are entirely impulsive and intrusive. I shout out ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true, your fianc√© does.‚Äù and all hell breaks loose.\n",

Generally speaking she is not a touchy-feely person, and to be frank, I had a lot to learn about how to please a woman in an...adult manner when we got married. She probably spent some time gritting her teeth while I got my rocks off early in our marriage. I always tried to make sure she had a good time, but men can be notoriously unobservant, and women have been known to pretend enjoyment without their partner's knowledge (something, something, When Harry Met Sally). Our sex life is currently better than it ever has been in the past, but its not meeting my needs.

When I presented the plans to my husband he said that we could go to more cities in Italy and he could help me edit pictures for my photography blog. However, he also said that he needed to have meetings and do administrative housekeeping and he needed to do it in person. I was disappointed and he got upset and asked me to stop rolling my eyes.

      "Some backgroud: I (27f) got engaged to my ex fiance (27m) around 2020, before covid started running rampant. We set boundaries for the relationship, and I made a lot more sacrifices to try and make things work. Right off the bat I got put on the pill, before our relationship started to take off. I largely blame the birth control pills for my strange passive behavior throughout our relationship, as it changed SO MUCH about me. I was more passive, more emotional, more anxious, and more aggressive and angry overall. I talked with him about getting a vasectomy, and each time he refused to talk about it/ got upset at me for wanting to explore that kind of BC. I just didn't want to feel like a different person. \n",

      "\n",
      "Third boundary, I wanted him to understand I did not want children. I had a baby already and it was the most horrible, Traumatic experience of my life and I had to be hospitalized for postpartum psychosis after DAYS of labor, and eventual failure to progress, meaning I had to have a cesarean. On top of all that, when they started cutting me open, I could feel it. I could feel so much I started vomiting and crying and begging, but since it had already started, they couldn't stop. So NO CHILDREN. I thought this was entirely fair.\n",

      "Well, months go by and we start talking about living together, being engaged, normal stuff when you are at this point in life.

If he really wants that and he cannot let it go, he needs to tell me and we can break it off. \n",

      "He agreed that he didn't want children, and so we pushed to move in together and be engaged. The first year was fine, we were in love and happy, until I started having issues with my BC because I got covid and it screwed up everything from my breathing, to my uteral health. I was bleeding for up to 16 days every cycle, meat started tasting like blood, I couldn't sleep, my anxiety was at an all time high.\n",

      "Bombshell. I was so angry, I was unable to keep it together. I storm out of our apartment and get into my car and drive, sobbing madly. I just kept thinking about how he broke that boundary, he lied to me about being fine with not having kids with me, and now he has me in this situation, where I share my life with him and I've spent all this time with him... and I felt like he wasted my time. Time I could've used finding the right partner. One who wouldn't have the childishness to expect me to risk my life, my wellbeing, my mentality... just to give him a baby. I couldn't fathom why he would be willing to risk me so he could have his \"dream\".\n",

It no longer felt like love, it felt like manipulation. \n",

I cried when I got home from relief of being listened to.\n",
      "\n",
      " Before this had happened I gave my fiance more leeway about the children thing. I told him the only way he would ever have what he wanted was if we lived in a place with better Healthcare for mothers. I found this justified, because of my serious mistreatment and trauma from my first birthing session. He agreed again, but slowly started backtracking that as well, saying he wants to stay near his family. I was incredibly frustrated, because I was lied to again. This was strike two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he gets home and I let him know what the doctor said, she had told me I was being messed up from covid and BC, that if I would get pregnant again she could tell from my history it would put my life in danger and she wanted to make sure I could be safe. She asked me if he would be willing to get a vasectomy because it would be easier. He was again very angry at me bringing it back up, but this time i didnt care. \n",

Now my mental health has skyrocketed, but he tells me I'm acting weird, I'm not myself, I'm more aggressive and he doesn't like it. I tell him it's just me, this is how I always was, this is who I am and I'm coming to my senses about who I want to be. He clearly dislikes me. He stopped wanting to hang out, we stopped planning dates, we never did anything I wanted to do. Naturally I started to pull away. Then i find my childhood friend online and we hit it off. \n",

      "I reminded him that I care about him and that I wanted this to work, but it seemed to me that he didnt like me anymore. He hadnt been filling my needs anymore. We talked about it before and it hadn't been fixed. He agreed that he needed to work on it. I disagreed, I said I felt like it was too late now and I wanted to have a go a polyamory now. \n",

      "\n",
      "Then, December 21st starts my holiday celebration. I told him I would like us to spend dinner together because, after all this I still love him and want to have a good holiday with him. I come home from work and get upset because he ate without me, and broke his promise. I ask him if he even wants to spend any time with me at all. He doesn't. My little heart is broken into bits again and I want so badly to lash out at him but I just cry as he dumps me right there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think I did anything wrong here, I was sure I made all of my intentions clear from the beginning. But from his perspective I seem to be cold and heartless. I tried desperately to be friends but he dropped me so fast it was crazy, like I meant nothing to him this whole time. AITA?\n",

      "I adored being pregnant, I loved the experience up until the birthing part. The birth was over 3 days long and the epidural they gave me stooped working as well which caused me to be in awful pain during the cesarean (and the doctor in training freaked out and couldn't handle the pressure so instead of 10 minutes it took around 30 for the procedure)\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't find any doctors willing to help me get anything done with my uterus, and I had searched for years. Literally years. I live in the deep south.

There was not, I just have PMDD\n",

      "\n",
      "I had three jobs and worked 86 hours a week, making getting any doctors appointments incredibly hard and scheduling a surgery even harder. Yes I was the breadwinner. Even after all of that I still made time to cook and clean and take care of him and I wanted to have time to spend together. He didn't because he said he was too tired all the time. He worked 38-40 hour weeks. It shows that not as much effort was going in on his part imo.\n",

      "Besides how it sounds, we had a very loving relationship with little problems of the course of 4 (almost 5) years we were together. We never argued expect in these instances and if we disagreed I was oftentimes the one to have to suck it up and console him and his emotional side, which is fine, but he never did that for me so it felt like I was a mother to him instead of a partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was asking for commitment the entire time, and he refused to commit. Engaged and nothing else, and I tried to talk to him about why but he never talked to me.

Me and her have always been close and ever since we were kids have been close but as we grew up I started to notice her small jealousy towards me. For example on my 18 birthday she complained about the amount of gifts I got and that she didn‚Äôt get as much gifts as me but that was because she go to go on a vacation with her friends and also got gifts. Another time is when she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù spilled juice all over the new dress my grandmother bought me for my graduation even tho the dress was hanged up in my closet. Recently as expected I was invited to her wedding and I was so happy for her. We went dress shopping for the brides maids and for my dress and everyone was having a great time until the dress were given. Each brides maid was given a beautiful tight fit royal blue dress while my dress because I was the maid of honor had a beautiful design with a flowers on the straps and a darker blue color. Each girl came out and showed my sister their dress and she was very excited, until I came out and showed her my dress and she lost her smile and had a frown on her face. She then stated that she did not like the dress and that she didn‚Äôt expect it to look good on me and that she would prefer me to wear the brides maid dress. I looked at her shook asked her if she was joking but she was not. So I put on the other dress to avoid conflict and when I came out and showed her she again was not happy. She then said that she didn‚Äôt like that ethier on me because it ‚Äú fit me too well‚Äù and that if I wanted to be the maid of honor I had to wear something more casual because it would ‚Äúmake her look bad‚Äù. Everyone was silent and i stood there confused and then told her calmly that no offense but it‚Äôs not my fault if the dress ‚Äú fit me too well‚Äù and that if it was the dress making her upset then she needs to stop being jealous. She then started to get mad and told me that if I was a good sister I would stop acting like a b*tch and stop dressing like a  h*e for the sake of her wedding. She then also stated that I was ruining her wedding day by acting like that and I don‚Äôt have be better that everyone else by sticking out like a sore  thumb. At that point I was angry so I proceeded to leave and then days before her wedding I got calls and text from family members saying that I was wrong for ‚Äúbeing rude‚Äù and ‚Äú wanting to have the attention on me‚Äù when it was not like that at all. So when the day of her wedding came I didn‚Äôt go and also figured my sister would have a field day if I did anyway. Hours later my family texted me that I ‚Äúhad to stop being selfish and come because it was making my sister upset‚Äù. At that point I was enraged, I turned my phone on silent and didn‚Äôt respond. Days later my sister showed up to my apartment and told me that ‚Äú I ruined her wedding day and that I shouldn‚Äôt be mad that the spotlight isn‚Äôt on me for once‚Äù. I instantly told her to leave and told her she wasn‚Äôt invited to me and my boyfriend‚Äôs wedding. She was angry and called me names but i shoved her out. Months pass and we don‚Äôt talk anymore till my wedding day. Keep in mind I clearly stated I did not want her at my wedding and that she wasn‚Äôt invited. Hours pass  and it is time for me to walk down the Isle  and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. As i made my way down I saw my sister from the corner of my eye and she was holding a glass of whine. At that moment I pieced it together and jumped out the way and thankfully only a little spilled  on my dress. She began screaming calling\n",
      "Me names like h*e and sl*t and the tried to grab me but the security got her and threw her out. After that was over we continued and after my wedding I found out she then had later tried to attack someone else and got arrested.

      "\n",
      "It's a 2005 Pontiac GTO that mainly just sits in our garage. Greg absolutely loves that car for no apparent reason. The car spends basically all year sitting in our garage covered in a special blanket, and Greg drives it less than 10 times a year. He has always maintained that it‚Äôs a collector's item and that is why he wishes to keep it in such good shape, but I honestly don‚Äôt see the point. He only puts money into it and drives so little.\n",

      "\n",
      "  didn‚Äôt like this idea for two reasons. One, an old car seems unsafe, and two, that doesn‚Äôt solve the issue of the car taking up so much of our space. We argued about whether or not to sell the car for a few weeks, and Greg finally relented, and we did. We got a surprising amount of money from it (27k).\n",
      "With the money, I bought us two new TVs, several new appliances, a new couch, and several home improvement items, among other things. We have about 12k of the money remaining, which I plan to spend on renovating our backyard and garden in the spring. From the car, Greg and I both spent roughly $1500 on buying ourselves something.\n",

      "Greg has not been taking the car‚Äôs sale easily and often says things like he wishes he still had it and wonders if the dealership has sold it yet. A few days ago, he even started to mention how much sentimental value the car held. I was really annoyed by this since he had been doing this for days, and I did (probably too harshly) lash out at him. I said some things that probably weren‚Äôt kind and asked him to stop talking about it since we were beyond that point. He has not mentioned it since.\n",

      "Yesterday, I was on a group call with my mom (F77) and younger sister (F36). We were catching up and I mentioned how we‚Äôve been improving our home.

      "\n",
      "I told them that it was needlessly taking up space and we got good money for it. But they downplayed that and said things like how I couldn't put a price on items like that. When they asked how Greg took the situation, I told them about our most recent argument. \n",

(I know it sounds cheesy) I started off my saying no matter what I respect what she believes in although I didn‚Äôt Expect what she was going to say next. She said that being gay is a huge sin in her eyes and honestly it made me super disappointed because I am really passionate about politics and the right to love who you want is a strong belief in my eyes. ON TOP OF THAT IM BISEXUAL! And she doesn‚Äôt know that üò≠ so it‚Äôs crazy how she‚Äôs homophobic like that when she‚Äôs in love with a bi guy. I‚Äôm the last one to get offended by people‚Äôs beliefs most of the time but this one got to me. What do I do? (Edit, yes I do love her very much because of all the progress we have made together, although if I had known this in the beginning I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve worked out, I feel like if I stay I‚Äôm betraying the greater good and myself , although if I go I lose someone I love and I‚Äôm being rude about someone‚Äôs beliefs? Or is it good because they‚Äôre beliefs are harmful?) ANOTHER EDIT ( when we started dating, she wasn‚Äôt this conservative, just recently as in like 3-4 months ago she‚Äôs been exploring different careers and got involved with law enforcement therefore becoming Surrounded by people with these kind of views, it‚Äôs changed her a lot so it‚Äôs not like I knew this in the beginning 3 years ago and I‚Äôm still coming to reality with my sexuality and being comfortable with it. Sure some of you can call me an asshole for not telling her my sexuality before hand but tbh it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue either way.

Afterwards, my boyfriend ghosted me for a day and then came back and said \"we're good,\" but he's kindda distant. I know I'm not perfect, but I would have not acted the way I did if he didn't make fun of me and purposely buy me the drink I didn't want. It's very rude and belittling, I feel he antagonized me.

Him purposely getting me the wrong drink is just another controlling thing that he ALWAYS used to do. I don't like being controlled; he was too controlling. I think it's normal for people to lash out the way I did when they reach a breaking point. I'll be going to therapy to process the breakup and heal from the toxicity. I also agreed to clean his car.

So I decided to take the extra 20 minute drive since I could use sometime to clear my head. My fianc√© was waiting at my parents house for me and he genuinely looked pissed and had a hint of bight red from which I could make out that he had been crying for a while. My mom, dad, sister and sisters fianc√© were all there waiting for me. As soon as I walked my mother said something along the lines of ‚Äúoh gosh I can‚Äôt anymore, how could I raise a kid like this?‚Äù Although she intended to whisper it under her breath, it came out loud enough so everyone heard. Next was my fianc√©. He started crying and asked in a shaky tone ‚Äú how could you Jenna?‚Äù I was a bit surprised because I didn‚Äôt really know what he meant ‚Äú what babe? What did it do?‚Äù He cut me off before I could finish saying that. Now on an angry tone he screamed ‚ÄúHOW COULD YOU CHAET ON ME YOU LYING B:TCH!!‚Äù by now, my mom was balling whilst my dad put his arm around her shoulder. That when‚Äôs my sister finally spoke ‚Äúyou accidentally sent me the message as while back when you were drunk. I didn‚Äôt really want to show him but now that your getting married I have to.‚Äù I started sobbing at the sound of that. I would never cheat on my fianc√© I love him dearly. As I tried to protest, I was cut off, each word I said fell on deaf ears. My fianc√© left that same day, packing his bags and my mother kicked me out. They all thought i was a cheater! My fianc√© was sweet enough to let me keep the apartment that we bought together a year back. Today morning, I got a text from a dummy number saying ‚Äúyou should‚Äôve just let me e happy with MY dress, now you pay for trying to ruin my big day.‚Äù This was my sister. She has devised a plan to turn everyone against me because of a dress?!? Now I‚Äôm laying on the couch, sobbing because how could some one do something so cruel over a dress? I know that I shouldn‚Äôt have made my family unattended her wedding but did she really have to ruin my whole life. I really don‚Äôt know what to do.

      "Well the story is exactly as the title states, I (25M, 24 at the time) had a girlfriend (23F) that didn't like how appreciative and affectionate I am as a boyfriend. So she cheated on me with her boy best friend who just recently got out of jail for burglary in the 1st degree and assault with a deadly weapon. After this she started changing her behaviors as I did not know what had happened and became obviously distant so I broke it off with her, her family began asking me what happened and where the disconnect came from why I was so adamant in my decision and I had told them that she just wasn't interested anymore and it showed. After this her sister and I began growing closer together as friends and eventually went on a date that ex and her boy bestfriend showed up to about 25 minutes after us. They sat a bit of ways away and I didn't really pay much attention as I was more focused on my new best friend and I was enjoying myself just being friends with her. About an hour later as we were talking, my ex comes over while the Boy bestfriend was leaving and dumps the last of my steak on my lap and walks out. 15 minutes later I take her sister home then go for a short drive before returning home myself only to receive a text from an unknown number saying \"hey bitch boy this is what happened when I was with her hope you enjoy fuck n!gga\" and next came the vid 5 minutes long of him finishing inside her. My exs parents the next day asked if I wanted to come over and work on cars as myself and her dad were quite good friends. I politely declined and sent them the vid of my ex cheating to which her father called apologizing and crying we talked for a few hours and to this day are decently great friends as well me and her sister. What should I have done differently?\n",

      "EDIT: what alot of people seem to not understand is firstly, myself and the boy bestfriend are both black. Secondly I do not believe this was revenge porn as this was an unsolicited video I did not ask for. Third, the reason why I say she cheated is because she went to pick this guy up when he got out of jail and it had taken 2 hours, and the boy bestfriend said \"this is what I did with her\" and Fourth, the father on the phone asked for clarity and I handed it to him, myself and the sister were friends before I even met my ex so why should that entirely platonic relationship end just because my ex cheated that's something I don't understand.\n",

      "So I (46f) have 3 kids, their dad is in their lives we are still happily married. My oldest (20m) , Noah, had a baby girl named Franny. My middle (15f), Marina, is in her sophomore year of high school, I also have a little girl who is 12 but she isn't important to this situation. Marina has bad anxiety, PTSD, and depression, all diagnoses. She is not in therapy because it is too expensive and I don't want her to turn into an emotionless robot from meds and she is terrified of gaining weight from meds so she is not exactly getting help from all of her issues. She also recently developed the PTSD because she had a sureppressed memory or whatever it's called this summer of her Sexual Assault when she is 7. I completely believe her just so you all know and I went through something similar in my teens so I've been trying to help her through it but she can't get over it, it is affecting her way more than it ever effected me and I don't understand. she still can't tell me exactly what happened even though she remembered months ago and it happened almost a decade ago. \n",

Him and his girlfriend live with us. And Noah works 5 days a week from 9am to 9pm so he is not very present in Franny's life yet, but he loves her so much. The baby has a medical issue, it will not hurt her but could affect her sight in one eye in the future. Marina does help out with the baby and watches her when we need with little to no fight. She is a very good baby you don't even have to rock her or anything she just lays there and sleeps or stares at the ceiling so it's not that hard. Most of the time Marina is fine watching the baby but gets annoyed when it's multiple times a day or she is doing homework. Okay backstory finished.... \n",

      "Marina just started school, 10th grade. She has always gotten good grades and got an award for having above a 4.0 GPA last year. However, she does not have a good time at school. She had almost 50 abcenses last year because school makes her so anxious. The people not the material. She was bullied in elementary school and middle school, as far as I know she is not being bullied but there was draman last year with this friend who started talking about  her to other people. She could barely go to school for 4 days a week and almost always called home on one of the days of the week because she couldn't bear to be around \"people her age\" as she says. This year she pledged that she would miss as little school as possible and I'm holding her to it. Today I was at a doctors appointment with Franny and her mom, it was for Franny's medical condition I was talking about earlier. She is getting put on new medication because the first one wasn't working. Marina texted me and said she was having a bad \"enotional\" day and I replied something along the lines of \"At doctors appointment. Sorry.\". This isn't the first time Ive had to prioritise my granddaughter, but it's not her fault! She is only a baby and needs so much help and Marina is very self-sustainable and mature for her age. After I picked up Marina from school we got into a little argument. She got an attitude with me and said that I care more about Franny and her mom than her. A little more was said and it ended with me calling her a spoiled brat and that Franny is a helpless baby and needs lots of attention. Marina went and cried in her room. I tried to go in and comfort her but she locked her door and wouldn't let me in. Noah heard about the situation and said I shouldn't have yelled at Marina but he and his girlfriend appreciate my help and his girlfriend really needed me at the appointment. Marina talked to Noah's girlfriend and told her about what happened at school. Apparently she was talking with a friend and was leaned over a desk. A boy tried to get past her and happened to brush against her butt and it reminded her of her sexual assault and it ruined her day. She said she knew the bot didn't do it in purpose but it still hurt her and made it hard to focus for the rest of the day. \n",

      "So my husband and I have been together for 6 years now He‚Äôs a really good guy and I feel so lucky that he‚Äôs mine.  Before I got pregnant I used to do all of the cooking and cleaning as I‚Äôm a stay at home wife and my husband works full time. but now that I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant I don‚Äôt have the energy to cook or clean anymore so now it falls on my husband to have dinner ready and everything kept neat and tidy. He‚Äôs never complained once and he actually seems happy to be doing chores and cooking for me or anything else I tell him to do. He really fell in love with cooking though and he tells me he wants to be a chef now. He‚Äôs constantly showing me new recipes he wants to try and make for me and he‚Äôs always jamming out to music in the kitchen while he cooks. Here‚Äôs where the issue comes in. My husband has never been the best cook. He‚Äôs not bad at all and he‚Äôs made some amazing dishes.  He‚Äôs just clearly not up to my level and it shows. Last night he made me ‚ÄúJerk chicken‚Äù with Jamaican rice from this recipe he‚Äôs been talking about making for the past week. He‚Äôs been really excited to try and and make it and I was really excited to try it since I‚Äôve never had it. Once dinner was ready he called me to the kitchen and the food looked and smelled amazing only thing was it didn‚Äôt taste amazing again my husband isn‚Äôt a bad cook but the chicken was so bland and it tasted like cinnamon. Needless to say I was pretty disappointed in him and asked my husband if he could just go pick up a pizza or something. He seemed sad I didn‚Äôt like the food and asked if I thought he was a bad cook. I told him honestly ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not terrible but I could‚Äôve made it better‚Äù I thought by telling him Atleast he‚Äôs not a terrible cook he‚Äôd be happy with that. But he just got up without saying anything and left to get the pizza. After he got back he handed me the box of pizza and left upstairs to go to sleep. He‚Äôs been acting cold and stoic with me ever since last night. AITA here?\n",

You wouldn't say that about our real children.\" I responded with \"Of course I would.\" My wife stated that it would be developmentally harmful to them and again tried to say \"if our child was doing a puzzle, you wouldn't laugh at them for struggling to find the right pieces\". I told them that if our child was smart enough to do a puzzle, it was smart enough to know I was laughing at it and it would do no harm to laugh at a child that is too young to be aware it's being laughed at. that got tears in their eyes and ran out of the house and drove to their sister's and refuses to speak to me. \n",

      "About ten hours after my dad tragically passed away, I made a decision that I now feel guilty about. At the time, I was just a 9-year-old kid who loved playing video games, and Call of Duty was my absolute favourite. My dad had left some money behind for the rent, which my family desperately needed, but I impulsively used ¬£200 of that money to buy the latest instalment of Call of Duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where the conflict comes in. My family was going through a really tough financial situation. We were almost in poverty, struggling to make ends meet. The money my dad left behind was meant to keep a roof over our heads, pay for food, and other necessities. However, in that moment, I was completely consumed by my love for the game, and I made a selfish decision that I now regret deeply.\n",

      "On one hand, I was just a child dealing with the loss of my father and trying to find some comfort in the things I loved.

      "I talked with my friends and mother and sister about this and they all think my husband is being unreasonable but I still feel horrible so I hope I can get some honest opinions here. I‚Äôm (F25) pregnant with my husband (M25) and we just found out last week that we‚Äôre having a girl. I was so happy and my husband was happy with this news too. He told me later that night that he thought he would be disappointed that we weren‚Äôt having a boy but that he‚Äôs surprisingly more happy and excited for our daughter. I shared with him how I understood and that I used to be so against the idea of having a son and that if we found out that day that we were having a boy I think I‚Äôd be pleasantly surprised with how excited I‚Äôd feel too. I then said that our first pregnancy revealed the gender to be a boy and this factor was a huge reason why I terminated the pregnancy. But a lot of time has passed and I think I‚Äôm truly ready now to have a boy. I know that decision was really hard for me and I didn‚Äôt talk about it much with him at the time because of how overwhelming everything was and I was still really young (21). But he understood even when I was really distant at some points and he was super supportive during the whole process. I was really thankful because even though we weren‚Äôt even married he and I were so excited to raise a child together so I was grateful he was still super understanding even when I suddenly decided to not have the baby. When I told him last week that the gender was a huge factor in my decision, he asked me if it was a girl would I have kept the baby and I said most likely. He got quiet and when I kept asking what‚Äôs wrong please talk to me he got angry and said I should‚Äôve told him this back then and that we could have been raising our 4 year old baby today. He kept going about how he thought I made that decision because he thought I just realized I wasn‚Äôt ready to have a baby and that I basically lied to him. I never said that kind of stuff back then but I can understand how my avoidant attitude and distance made it seem that way since he could only guess how I was feeling most of the time. I felt so hurt and guilty and I couldn‚Äôt help but start crying and I told him to leave. He has been sleeping at my MIL‚Äôs since then and he hasn‚Äôt been responding to my calls and texts apologizing for everything or my mother‚Äôs calls. \n",

      "I feel horrible and have been crying so much and I feel so alone and scared since he never gets angry and silent like this. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I wish I could go back in time and talk to him more back then but it was so hard for me since I was in such a bad place when I made that decision. I feel awful because he was so sweet and supportive back then and I wish I could change the past and tell him but I can‚Äôt. My family and friends think he just needs some time to get over this news and that he‚Äôs being horrible for making me feel this way when I‚Äôm having his child now with him and I just feel so alone with every reminder that he‚Äôs upset and avoiding me over this and that I hurt him this much. AITA for telling him all of this? Everyone around me says I don‚Äôt deserve this and even though I feel so abandoned by him right now I keep thinking I do deserve this.\n",

      "Edit: I realize that this may be an important part of my reasoning for my decision but I didn‚Äôt want the focus of this post to be centered on whether my decision was right or not since I can‚Äôt change that nor could I have predicted how difficult that time would be for me and I‚Äôve spent a lot of time coming to terms with my past. The only thing I wish I could‚Äôve done was talk to him more then but a lot of emotions and trauma and depression was shutting me down. Finding out the gender helped me realize I wasn‚Äôt ready. I had too much I still needed to work on and I believe I worked on myself enough to be at a place where I‚Äôm ready to be a mother to a daughter and especially a son. I just regret not letting him be a part of my journey to getting here and I feel torn because my support system is telling me he should be more understanding and not shut me out especially right now but I feel like I deserve this not for my decision but how I dealt with it without him\n",

      "Sorry for the late night post as I‚Äôve been at work all day. My (39M) daughter is 17 years old. She‚Äôs been dating her 18 year old boyfriend for 6 months. Good guy, no issues with him. I have the typical rules like no boy in the bedroom, stay in the living room, no inappropriate stuff, have her home by 10pm, etc. I like to think me and my daughter have an open relationship. I‚Äôm always comfortable talking to her calmly and answering all of her ‚Äúwhys.‚Äù I always provide good reasoning behind everything I say. Since she was 12/13 years old, we started having talks about boys, puberty, sex. It was never a one-time talk. We would always have these discussions whenever I saw fit. I‚Äôve explained how teen sex is not a good idea, why it‚Äôs not a good idea, and the risks of it. I‚Äôve talked about all of the people who had sex at a young age and regret it, the guys who use girls for sex, and how the teenage brain is not ready to handle mature activities like that. I had these talks when she started dating her boyfriend as well. She seemed receptive to what I had to say which I appreciated. \n",

      "First time Reddit poster here, I apologize in advance if it does get lengthy I just wanna make sure I‚Äôm not leaving anything out. So my mom got evicted like 3 months ago, I ended up moving to another city with family because of it. I had to leave most of my stuff with her so it could be put in storage with her stuff. I left before she moved out so I couldn‚Äôt move my stuff myself I had no choice but to let her do it. However, I ended up moving back to our city a month later & we‚Äôre living together again unfortunately. After she moved out completely from her old place, I started asking her for access to the storage because I needed to get some stuff out, I had been asking her about it for like 3 weeks. I was finally able to go to the storage yesterday, when I asked her for the key she tried to act like she didn‚Äôt know where it was (which I knew was bullshit because she always keeps track of shit like that). I told her to look in her bag & see if it got lost in there then she magically finds them. That sent off all types of red flags because my mom is immature as fuck at her big ole age she still acts like a teenage brat with impulse problems, me & her have NEVER had a good relationship, it looked like we were close on the outside but that couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth. My mom should have never had kids, she can‚Äôt even take care of herself let alone 2 kids (if y‚Äôall want an essay about that lemme know). Anyway, so I get the keys & we make it to the storage. When I get inside & finally get to what I need it‚Äôs not there. I called her & asked about my stuff, she says ‚Äúwe had to take the stuff out & put it in bags because it was too heavy, while we were moving some kids helped us & they threw it out thinking it was trash‚Äù. That instantly pissed me off because why not just tell me that when it happened???? She said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how to tell you‚Äù BITCH BY OPENING YOUR FUCKING MOUTH & SAYING IT!!!! If it truly was an accident why not jus tell me. The fact that she didn‚Äôt just flat out tell me makes me think she‚Äôs lying about what actually happened & that she is in some way at fault or knows who is at fault. I had one of those big pink 3-drawer plastic containers from Walmart that I used to put my hair care stuff in, it was FULL of shit. I had everything in there, flat iron, blow dryer, hot comb, regular combs, brushes, hair ties, actual hair products & ALL OF MY MAKEUP. I‚Äôm a natural girly that does her own hair so IYKYK them products is EXPENSIVE, plus I actually do hair as a side hustle so I‚Äôm S.O.L. (shit outta luck in case you‚Äôve never grown up around old black people lol) I can‚Äôt work right now & I have no transportation so I have no income right now to replace anything myself, I couldn‚Äôt replace every thing right now even if I wanted to because I had damn near $1000 worth of stuff that I accumulated over the last 4 years. I told her flat out she‚Äôs gonna need to go get a loan or something within this next week to pay me back (obviously not all of it but at least $200 so I can start getting some of my stuff back) because not only can I not do my own hair now, I can‚Äôt do any of my client‚Äôs hair.

Nor am I expecting her to get a $1000 loan, I clearly said in parenthesis at least $200 so I can start getting some of my stuff back. Also so I can get everything I need to do my hair for right now because that was the whole purpose of me going to the storage to get my hair stuff.

      "Hi. So I‚Äôll try and condense my somewhat complicated situation into a post. Here‚Äôs what I think is necessary to know: \n",
      "I (32f) live with my fianc√© (40m) and his daughter (15‚Äìalmost 16). We have been together since 01/2021, engaged since 02/2022, and living together since 04/2022. He has never had any formal custody arrangement with his ex wife (daughter‚Äôs mom) it has just been a bit of a free for all with no schedule or structure. His daughter (let‚Äôs call her Kimmy) has been adamant that she doesn‚Äôt want to go to her mother‚Äôs because she feels ‚Äúmistreated‚Äù by her mother and sisters. (Her Mother is remarried and has both older and younger children). While no overt mistreatment has occurred (and trust me, I inquired a lot) she doesn‚Äôt have her own room, has to share, and gets teased by her sisters. Her mother has taken a very hands off approach of ‚Äúif she doesn‚Äôt want to be here then don‚Äôt bring her‚Äù and her father (my partner) says that Kimmy is old enough to decide where she wants to be, which is with us, 100% of the time. A bit more context is that she‚Äôs an only child raised by her dad and has poor life skills and boundaries and is very immature (think 16 going on 12). I‚Äôm a psychologist by trade but through the years it has been made clear to me that my role is not to make suggestions and that I am not the parent. For over a year I pushed for her to have time with her mother because I felt it was important and her mom lives very close to us. Through kimmy‚Äôs resistance, and her mom‚Äôs apathy, and my partner feeling like he‚Äôs ‚Äúabandoning or rejecting‚Äù her- it has turned into her not going at all in almost 8 months. I settled several months ago for not pushing that she had to go to her mother‚Äôs, but that she had to go somewhere every other weekend (like a friends house).  This causes a lot of tension on several levels because he feels that it is solely for me to get a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from her and while yes, that is absolutely part of it, I also initially wanted it for her relationship with her mother, and for he and I to have time to ourselves in our relationship as well. we are at the point now we‚Äôre it seems hopeless to push the piece about her mother anymore but now I‚Äôm stuck wondering if I should just say she doesn‚Äôt need to go anywhere on a regular basis. I‚Äôm looking for genuine feedback I feel entitled in my opinion, but I‚Äôd like to know if I‚Äôm being unreasonable to the majority, and if so, I‚Äôd like to hear what those people think. Let it be known that I support her in every way on a daily basis and don‚Äôt treat her any differently than I would my own child. I also ensure that they have plenty of one-on-one time together. Regarding one more factor about myself, I do have some mental health issues of my own that make it difficult sometimes to regulate (ocd and ptsd), but I don‚Äôt get disregulated in front of her and see a therapist regularly for my own health.  \n",
      "I mostly feel stuck, because if I just throw up my hands and say she can be here all the time I feel, I will have resentment, potentially towards both of them, but if I don‚Äôt, I feel that they both resent me.  Any feedback appreciated really. Thanks in advance.\n",
      "EDIT: I truly do appreciate the honest feedback from everyone. While I am absolutely soliciting the opinions, I don‚Äôt think attacking my profession or assuming my professional abilities is fair or productive. This may come as a shock to some, but even professionals have personal  struggles. Just like physicians get sick, psychologists are people too. Carry on by all means but- please be kind. \n",

This was a big surprise because we both kept a healthy lifestyle and we were seemingly very healthy for our age. The stroke has severely limited his ability to operate independently. While he can still do basic tasks such as walking, talking, and eating, he can't do much beyond that without my assistance. The doctors say he'll probably be like that for the rest of his life. At this point, I feel like I'm putting much more into the relationship than I am getting out and it is limiting my happiness because taking care of him is such a big toll.

      "Throwaway account here. So I'm friends with this girl (never met her in person) on Facebook and she used to like a lot of my posts. I struck up a conversation on messenger and we talked for a while and I kinda ended up crushing on her a bit. She was slow on the replies but said she more frequently uses Whatsapp. So we exchanged numbers. The first few times I called her she didn't answer but she eventually did and agreed to hang out when I asked. We're at a coffee place talking when she mentions she has a boyfriend. I'm disappointed but don't mention it. Later that evening I tell her over text I had a great time, she's amazing company and she would totally be my girl if she didn't have a boyfriend though I kinda meant that last part as a joke. She said she had a great time too and I was a pretty cool guy...and that was it. It's been over a month and she hasn't texted at all since. Not picking up my calls, ignoring me on social media. My sister says I deserve it though and I was an AH because it was inappropriate to tell her she would be my girl if she didn't have a boyfriend. I'm wondering why she even agreed to go out with me in the first place but she says she was probably just trying to be nice and let me down easy in person or might have just thought of me as a friend. \n",

      "First some background.  My friend told that she was thought she was pregnant.  Baby daddy some dude she had an on/off LDR. When she first thought she was they weren't talking and she didn't want to tell him. She has some health stuff so fine.  Even after she found out for sure she still wouldn't tell him.  I kept telling her she needed to. \n",
      "\n",

      "Now no one is talking to me. She won't talk to me because I told another one of our friends and they told her so most of our friends won't talk to me either. I'm not sure y he won't.  But the two of them still aren't talking to each other weeks later according to the one friend that is still talking to me a little bit. \n",
      "\n",
      "But for real there is a baby coming and she won't say shit to the dad. The longer she waits the harder it'll b.  If something happens because of her health stuff then what?  Surprise kid on his doorstep?  Or never tells him at all? That seems unfair to the kid. So AITAH here?\n",

      "\n",

      "I asked her to consider if maybe he wasn‚Äôt as bad as she thought and to try talking to a therapist about it. I mentioned our future kids, and also that he‚Äôs getting older so she might not want to miss the chance to have a relationship with him while she can. \n",

      "I am a bride getting married soon. I really want this to be my day with the attention on me, so I don't want other women to wear dresses with deep cleavage or excessive midriff, etc - basically any style that would cause a lot of attention to divert to them. I have a few friends who dress on the risqu√© side, and I love that for them in general, but do not want this on my big day so I feel like I need to say something. I asked my cousin her thoughts. My cousin is mad at me, saying I don't get to dictate what people wear, and says I should 'uplift' women rather than 'limiting' them.\n",

      "I don't think I am limiting them. I see it as it's my big day, and on this one day, I should be able to have the entire spotlight, and reduce instances of other women's beauty making me feel 'less-than'. I think it is crappy that she would make me feel bad about this, and not support my dreams for my big day. AITAH? Is there a better way I can communicate this to guests without sounding like an AH?\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: I have received a lot of very condescending comments, so want to clarify a few things:\n",
      "\n",
      "1- I may have some personal insecurities, but I do not have any desire for others to look 'like shit', I just felt that an extra inch of coverage would give me that much more breathing room on a day where I will be nervous as is. I am not asking for people to dress like maids, just would encourage it subtly on the invitation where the dress code is listed. People often see 'shoulders covered, knee length dress' for a wedding in a church or synagogue. I am nowhere near that, just hoping for people to choose the slightly higher neckline or the dress that shows a bit less skin than the other. I also would not have my day be ruined if someone shows up in a scantier dress than hoped for. \n",
      "\n",
      "2- This is one small factor in my big day. Just because you read a reddit post, does not mean you know me or anything more about my life and my priorities. I have a million other considerations that are more important that this one, I guess I was just testing the waters of peoples' thoughts for something that affects their experience of an event like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "3- I also talked to my cousin more, and showed her this post to discuss, and upon more communication we realized that were were misinterpreting each other. She thought I was planning on being a 'naz\\*' about it, but sees listing a dress code that encourages modesty as very reasonable. In the future, we won't text about these things - as we see here on reddit, a short spiel in writing through a screen can be wildly misinterpreted and lead to confusion and anger. I overreacted too, she was not meaning to come off the way I interpreted it, and I could have saved myself a lot of trouble by not posting here on impulse. \n",
      "\n",
      "4-Lastly, my fianc√© and I have a very strong, trusting, and loving relationship. We have waited 8 years to get married. The 'jealous' phase passed in the first few months of our relationship when we were in our early 20s and new to trust in a relationship, and we have no issues as such today. It is very strange how many people are saying I am 'not ready' for marriage, or that we will 'divorce'. \n",
      "\n",
      "5- All constructive criticism and support has been good to consider, but to those of you using derogatory language and belittling me - you have made me grateful for how loving and level-headed my friends and family are. Your words will not weigh on me. I did not realize how ugly the reddit community can sometimes be, lesson learned. \n",

She will sometimes lash out at me for not being there and I hate the arguing.\n",

I ended up telling one friend and my new partner. With that, I sent screenshots of some of our texts to the new partner to ask how to handle my ex‚Äôs anger. I ended up telling my ex I did this and she flipped out. She said I disrespected her privacy and potentially exposed her at work, even though I know my partner will keep it quiet. Some of the texts showed that she was clearly struggling with her mental health after the termination, which my ex says is embarassing for her and was private. I just wanted advice from my partner, even though my partner at times did imply the ex is kinda crazy. My ex also messaged my new partner asking her to stay quiet, which my new partner ignored which of course upset the ex.\n",

I know my partner would not do this. I met up with my ex and as we were discussing this she pulled over, told me she hates me and is so upset that I exposed her and tried to kick me out of her car. I said that she was awful for leaving me stranded and she said its worse that I abandoned her while she was pregnant and then told people.

We have known eachother for approximately 2 years, we met in a club and we have been friends up until a year ago when we got together. We have been taking things slow, since I didn't want to rush things, and I still had some unresolved trauma from past relationships that I was working hard on to resolve with my therapist. I have been thinking about going on a vacation with him, I am not really a plane person so I told him we should drive to a nearby beach together for a few days since we both have been working hard and we were exhausted, or so I thought he was working. He became flustered when I mentioned the vacation and he has been distant ever since. This happened around my birthday which was not long ago. I was saddened by his reaction because he always told me he loved to travel and has been to many places before, even showing me pictures of his travels. \n",

      "I started to sense something, something was just not right with him, he was nervous all the time when we were together. One day he came over just to sleep with me and when the deed was done he was very down, but he never told me why. Well, I found out on my own anyways while he was in the shower. He left his phone on my bed and an unsaved number kept spam calling him, but when I wanted to pick up, the ringing was done. I went through his phone and found that a woman has been spamming him with texts, asking where he was at because she was feeling very ill and was worried about their baby. I was so shocked when I found out about this, but managed to keep myself together for the sake of my mental health, and saved her number on my phone.\n",

      "The next few days were rough, I was anxious about this whole thing, I couldn't really keep my mind off of what I saw and read. It all started to make sense now, why he never slept over, why he only stayed for a couple of hours untill heading off to the \"gym\" or \"going out with his friends\", why he was secretive and private of his phone. Which is so funny to me, how one mistake (him leaving his phone on my bed) exposed his little secret. \n",

I explained the situation to her and her sobs and screaming hurt my heart. She told me that she had a feeling he was having an affair with someone, because ever since she told him she was pregnant he was so distant towards her. I told her we could do something about him since he both lead us on and betrayed our trust. \n",

She told me that she is 5 months pregnant, after suffering multiple miscarriages and she is afraid to lose her baby again. I comforted her as we talked about our next move. Turns out that Jason has been isolating her from her friends so she really had noone to talk to, she told me it was such a weight off her chest that she had someone to talk to, even if that someone is her husbands mistress. She told me that we should gather all the evidence of him cheating and him isolating her from her friends and that she was going to file for divorce after her next appointment at the doctor. We talked for a little while and I told her to keep in touch with me as I care about her safety and wellbeing. A few weeks have passed since me and Laura met, I have been driving her to her appointments, and she showed me around their house while Jason was out, joking about that \"I must be happy I am finally here since Jason never took me here\". \n",

I started to kiss her back and one thing led to another and after we had sex, we fell asleep. \n",

      "Well, we didnt wake up before Jason came home. He lost his shit, he was screaming and threw nasty names at us, telling us that we ruined his life and the perfect opportunity to create a family with Laura and the baby, he told me I should go fuck myself and that I was always just a toy for him that he used to relieve his stress on. He said that I was such an asshole for doing this to him and he trusted me even though he only used me. The arguement resulted to Laura breaking down and standing up for herself and me. Hours have gone by already by just arguing and Jason ultimately decided to kick me and Laura out. \n",

      "I took Laura home with me and gave her space, made her food and pampered her, knowing that this must be hard on her.

For the past 2 years every time we have hung out with them Christina has been saying she wants a baby. It was constantly brought up and she would get very upset at times because of how badly she wanted a baby. Joe also wanted a baby but thought he was infertile because it just never happened, despite never using protection. Joe actually booked himself an appointment to get checked. They found out 8 weeks ago that they were expecting, a week before his scheduled appointment to check fertility. He was over the moon. So was she, originally.

She started using the baby against him fiercely. He's not in a position to buy another house right this very second. He sent me screenshots of their conversations and they were bad. She was seriously just losing her shit on him for stuff outside of his control and threatening to end the babies life over mundane things (ie: \"well if you don't do this than the baby is dead\" or \"you're going to be the reason why this baby doesn't make it because you stress me TF out\"- all because they were arguing about him picking up an extra shift that weekend). So, I text her and I didn't tell her that Joe had asked me to. I simply tried talking to her about what she was going through mentally. She seemed to calm down but she went and got an abortion 2 days later and when Joe asked her why she would do that, she said \"you should have listened to me and did what I asked\". I lost every ounce of respect I had for her. I am pro-choice but this is fucked up. I no longer want anything to do with this woman. My husband, while he agrees that she is ignorant, says that we should just stay out of it because it's not our business. And that's true, but I never want to see her again- which would heavily limit how much I interact with Joe because I doubt he will leave her (though I think he should). AITA?\n",

      "So, we took 5-6 sessions for 3 months but we did not get any straight forward advice from the therapist. We had a chat and decided to set some ground rules on our own.\n",
      "Rules: \n",
      "1. Only masturbate when she is having periods.\n",
      "2. If she is away from home for 2 days ( I wanted 1 but then settled).\n",
      "3. No mobiles allowed in washroom (except when Rule 1 is in place).\n",

I asked her why she is in balcony as it was cold but she said she just want to have fresh air. I came back scroll my phone and found the reddit post tab. She came back and I told her this post was before the rules and she said OK and went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 3 months went without any issue however I found it unsettling to masturbate on specific days. Because if I take my phone with me then I make it obvious that what are my plans. I don't want to announce intentionally/unintentionally what am I going to do. Result: No masturbation for 3 months.\n",

      "So, yesterday my wife went to the doctor and I was alone at home. So, I did the deed and broke the rules.\n",
      "Now she knows, I don't know how and she is really upset/angry/betrayed and asked me for divorce. She called her sister to come and pick her up but get sister was trying to understand what's the actual issue.\n",

      "Edit: I think it's necessary to clear a few things: Our sex life is not very active (one to three in a month). Around 1.5-2 years back, I was on depression medication and it totally ruined my libido at that time. Now I have been off medicine for 9-10 months but it's not the same now. My libido has decreased now and it irritates her that I can masturbate but can't have frequent sex with her. So, that's an added reason for her to be mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I am not a porn addict, I asked the therapist also if that's the case but she did not confirm it. I don't have any reference or some one to sit and talk to therefore I turn to reddit if what I am doing is normal or abnormal behaviour? Do married men see porn, do they masturbate , what's the frequency of sex, what defines a porn addict? Although we have sex few times a month but it's not like someone begged or forced it is mutual and we both enjoy it. \n",
      "\n",
      "One more thing she asked to have a second opinion from our family doctor during our initial session with the therapist about his thoughts on this issue. I went alone (because Wife has to go to physiotherapy) and he said it is very normal that everyone does that, everyone watches porn, everyone masturbates, you should stop agreeing on these rules and I have control over your body. To be honest, the way and tone in which he made that comment he generalized that every woman wants to have that control and will become worse if I keep agreeing to these rules. So, that put me off and I assumed that he has some very biased opinion. And I told that thing to my wife and we decided to not follow his advice.\n",

      "Some back story, my husband had an affair with a married woman before he met me. Her husband was apparently very abusive (and infertile), and my husband kept trying to \"rescue\" her from him. One thing led to another, then she got pregnant after a while and they had a son.\n",

      "\n",
      "He told me about this, and actually I was annoyed because he will sometimes cry alone, or sometimes next to me and I mostly ignored it, for almost 15 years over the same thing. I told him he needs to get over it. Then he said he's trying to, but it still hurt too much. He said he finally has enough money for a gravestone for his son, and wants to buy it for him and bury his ashes next to his grandparents. I asked him what the point of that is, and told him I need him to be strong because we have 4 kids together, but he is often weak about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I told him the story of King David in the Bible, how King David's son was killed by God because of his sin of adultery with a married woman, and told him how David got over it quickly. I told him he caused this to happen, and God punished him by taking his kid. \n",
      "\n",
      "He stared at me in anger for about a minute and then started screaming at me to get the fuck out of the room and leave him alone. I refused, and said I will always tell him the truth, even if he doesn't want to hear it. He began screaming louder, getting so angry, and then stormed out of the house and disappeared for several days and now wont talk to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am in complete disbelief by his actions and do not understand why he can't accept the truth and repent, but I am continuing to pray for him. AITA?\n",

      "So my (51F) daughter (27F) has been married to her husband for 4 years, but says that she has had enough and that it was time to leave. Her husband is a rather paranoid person who was cheated on by a fiance many years ago and she found out that he put something on her phone to read all her emails and text messages. She also realized that he was using a security company to follow her car, while all the time letting her think for a year and a half that a guy she rejected years ago was possibly back and following her.\n",

I told her yes, but maybe I shouldn't because of the hole her divorce put me in against my will.\n",

We‚Äôre recommending a lot of books to each other and getting through a lot of them. Also, it‚Äôs not like I ask to tickle her daily. It‚Äôs like once a week, if that.

During this conversation, she asked me if I would still love her if she had a penis. I laughed a little at the question cause it seemed a little strange, but always try to answer her question honestly even if I think they are a little silly. I (somewhat jokingly) said of course, as long as it was smaller than mine. She laughed and said fine, and then asked how big I thought hers would be. I thought for quite a bit, before I gave my honest answer.\n",

      "I (47f) have an argument with my son (21m) last night. Ever since he turned 15 he has brought all his gfs home which I don¬¥t mind at all. Whatever he does in his bedroom is okay, it¬¥s his safe place. He can bring anyone he wants as long as they don¬¥t do something ilegal or harmul to themselves. Anyway, I¬¥ve tried to be a great mom, and I knew that he was going to start having sex at some point. However, nobody told me I had to hear my son fucking a girl. I mean, it¬¥s just a NO for me. It¬¥s not like he had never had a gf over, it¬¥s just i¬¥ve never heard them doing anything. I figured they were having sex, but never had to actually be aware of it WHILE they were doing it. This is a new gf, and she is a nice girl. It¬¥s just that a few months ago, I started to hear some moaning from his room, it was late at night, I was  in the bathroom, and it just really threw me off. I just didn¬¥t know what to think. I¬¥m very open about sex and I have no issue with him doing anything, but damn. I wasn¬¥t ready for this. It happens almost everyday she comes over. It¬¥s almost evident when she¬¥s not around cuz there¬¥s no noise comming from his bedroom. This never happened with his ex gf.  This new girl is really stunning btw, I mean, the kind of girl that people stare a lot in the street. My son showers her with compliments almost everyday. My own mom tells her she¬¥s beautiful, and she really is. I¬¥m not trying to be mean or anything, but my son is average, not saying he¬¥s ugly, but c¬¥mon, she really is out of his leage looks wise. She¬¥s also pretty shy, and and they¬¥ve being dating for a few months. I never hated or loved any of his gfs, the truth is that I don¬¥t really care about that. I¬¥m always there if he asks for advice, but never tried to tell him what to do or who to date. Last night, right after she left I told my son that I needed to have some minute with him. He¬¥s such a nice boy, so I told him that he should think about having his business with his gf elsewhere. He looked confused, so I told him c¬¥mon, you know what I mean, everyone in this house has heard it, and it makes me uncomfortable. He got mad which I found weird, he said that I was being controlling and I just can¬¥t expect him not to have sex which is not what I meant at all. He said that he was going to move out cuz i¬¥m a \"boy mom\" and he wasn¬¥¬¥t gonna allow it. I got super mad for calling me that so I told him he was free to go, and at least I didn¬¥t have to hear the princess and the frog fucking  He then said I was vulgar and went to his bedroom. He¬¥s not talking to me and I don¬¥t want him moving out, but I don¬¥t think I should apologize. AITAH?\n",

Our financial journeys were quite contrasting from the outset; I made a comfortable $150k, whereas she excelled with a $400k salary as a tech executive. Despite the high cost of living, I had saved $80k, only to have it vanish when she indulged in a spending frenzy on high-end hotels, a luxury car lease, and extravagant gifts for her friends, pushing us $40k into debt. Despite my devastation, I forgave her following her tearful pleas for forgiveness. My career took a turn for the better, and as I started earning over $1M per year, I managed to pay off our accumulated debts.\n",

I can make an update post too if needed, a person suggested that I post a photo of the receipt, I did, but it feels gross to me to take a photo to prove i did something when i know well enoughthat the act of going back is enough.

Seemingly perfect health, no complications, just a sudden heart attack while driving home from work. He got off the highway safely, but the paramedics didn‚Äôt reach him in time. My siblings and I cried in each others arms for days, and then lived in hell on Earth until the funeral. I never saw my mother cry or even show a shred of grief. I assumed that she was just trying to be strong for her children, there was no way she wasn‚Äôt hurting after the death of the love of her life. The funeral was last Saturday, I watched everyone shed a tear except for my mother. Still, I brushed it off as nothing. Afterwards, my siblings and I decided to take time off of work/school to stay with our mother and comfort each other. One night, I came home late from the bar, a little intoxicated, and stumbled to the bathroom to take a shower. I walked into my mother‚Äôs bedroom for some pajamas, since we are the same size in clothes. When I opened the door, I found her in bed with a man I didn‚Äôt recognize, wearing a lingerie set I also had never seen. It was very obvious what they were doing. I stood there, mortified. They were going at it so hard, they didn‚Äôt even see me walk in. When I heard my mother say ‚ÄúYou do it so much better than John,‚Äù (John was my father) I ran out and slammed the door behind me. I then packed my bags and drove back to my apartment. Now I‚Äôm being spammed with texts and calls from my mother, as well as my siblings. All of which are calling me an asshole for leaving them after the death of our father, as well as defending my mother, saying she was ‚Äújust coping.‚Äù I responded to my younger sister only, and said that if her or any of my siblings want to meet me, they can, but I won‚Äôt be in contact with my mother, since she seems too busy replacing the man who died 2 weeks ago. I then blocked my mother on everything. A couple days later, my mother came to my apartment, wanting to talk. I unwillingly let her in. She started apologizing and making excuses for what she did. I told her to save it, and that I wasn‚Äôt falling for anything. I said I was disgusted with how she could sleep with other men mere days after her husband‚Äôs funeral, and that I wished it was her in that casket instead. She started crying, and I kicked her out.

I have a son so he was, of course, everywhere i went. he used to bring his sister along every single weekend with us. and while he didnt ask to bring her around, i felt like i couldnt truly be myself or ask him any personal questions to know him better. on top bringing her along, he would spoil her like crazy. i mean, he would buy her whatever she wanted. while i was working and earning my money, he never actually got out of his way to get something for me to make feel special. this went on until he moved with me because he was living with his parents. once he moved out, every single time we would visit his mom or she would call him, it was always to just ask for something. either money or to buy her something. it started to bug me and i told him that its not ok for her to just be calling to be asking for so many things! she once kept telling me so many times that she wanted a dog and i helped her get a dog because i felt bad for her. it really seemed like she wanted a dog. but was i completely wrong. his parents were having a bump in their marriage and i decided to step up & welcome his mom in our home for a while. she only stayed there a week because she felt more comfortable at her house. my fiance‚Äôs sister goes to school really far away and she couldnt watch over the dog due to her crazy schedule. so her mom brought the dog over to our house but i had to potty train him because he was not house trained. after she left back to her own house, i talked to my fiance about keep the dog because they were going through something and i didnt want the dog to lose the habit of using the bathroom outside just in case she were to come back. needless to say, his mom was not happy and sad she couldnt take the dog with her. out of fustration, i texted his sister, letting her know to talk to her parents about leaving my fiance alone about the dog because he‚Äôs staying with us. she got upset, she called her dad and her dad called my fiance. my fiance blew up on me. while all this was happening, i was struggling with depression and anxiety. i wasnt working, i was always at home, my fiance was busy working extreme hours and it felt as if i didnt exist to him. so going back to my original story, everyone was upset with everyone. my fiance and i talked about it and we came to the conclusion to have a talk with his sister about the reason i blew up on her, when it was months worth of plain anger towards her. just as i knew, she made the entire conversion about her and about how one has ever taught her to do anything in life. this upset me because the whole conversation was supposed to be about my feelings and she turned it around and made everything about herself. after we were all done yelling at each other, i had a full blown anxiety attack and i couldnt stop crying for 20 minutes. after that, i blocked her on imessage, snapchat, instagram, and have not talk to her then. its been over a year and a few months. i couldnt understand why someone could be so careless when someone is struggling with depression. fast forward to right now. shes graduating college and my fiance is going. i cant understand why he would want to be there to help celebrate this person when this person has completely hurt me at one of the lowest points in my life. am i the asshole for not letting it go considering it did some damage to my mental state?\n",

But you can eat right there.‚Äù And points to a table RIGHT BEHIND US. *I should also mention that it‚Äôs a known thing here that there‚Äôs a few elderly persons that are upset with the breach in pool rules and feel the need to police anyone who breaks them.* She went on a bit of a rant, but when she was done I go, ‚ÄúListen I have seen many people eat here, throw full blown parties with food and even order food to the pool.‚Äù She starts going at me again and I said, ‚ÄúWhen everyone else follows the rules, so will I.‚Äù She was pissed and cussed a bit at me but eventually fucked off.\n",

I continued to tell her that she can report me, send an email, do whatever but she has no authority to enforce the rules. I can read the rules, and I chose to break them. Just like everyone else.

We show a little pda in public but nothing gross. However recently I've gotten a bit peeved because whenever we go out near where I live or practically anywhere in general he's always glancing at other women. He does it in a very subtle way but I catch him regardless. It's gotten to the point where he'll look not once or twice but about 3 times per woman while walking. He tells me I'm gorgeous and amazing but I feel like if I have to compete with all the attention he's giving other women then I don't want it. If I'm so great then why does he have to look so often. Im not socially acceptable pretty but I feel I offer more than those types of looks.\n",

      "I am 25F (I have a 28f sister) and my parents are both in their 60s. Growing up, we lived in a nice neighborhood in our city but in a small, outdated apartment (where my parents continue to live). My parents spent a lot on my education, I went to public school in a top rated district, but they paid for a lot of extracurriculars, expensive equipment for my sport, extra music lessons etc. The impression I got was that they were scrimping and saving to pay for this stuff. We took a vacation once a year to Europe (to visit family in Poland where my parents grew up) and would sometimes make short trips to other parts of Europe during this trips, but they were not \"lavish\" or \"luxury\" trips by any means - we'd stay in budget hotels, rent bikes and see the sights. After I graduated, we took a family vacation to SE Asia which was the most I'd ever seen them splurge, but it was still quite a modest trip compared to friends and classmates I grew up with in in our city, who would stay in fancy resorts, rent yachts etc. My parents had an old car they used until it broke down, and then bought another cheap, used car. We rarely got take out, our birthday parties were very simple and my sister and I shared a car when we were teenagers. My sense was that my parents worked very hard to give us an upper middle class lifestyle, but that we could not afford any big luxuries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Growing up, I felt that in order to live a \"rich\" successful life i would need to work my ass off because my parents weren't rich, which is what I did. I got into a great university and got a very competitive job that puts me on track for a very lucrative career. My parents did pay for my degree which I am very grateful for, and am also  very grateful to my parents for inculcating a strong work ethic and drive in me, and my sister is in a similar position. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently while home I came across some documents that made me realize that my parents are RICH. Like multi-million dollar rich. I won't get into details for privacy reasons, but they have had a net worth of more than 10 million since I was a baby.  My father sold a company then and has essentially not needed to work at all (he and my mom worked their asses off while we were growing up despite not needing to). \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel very misled and confronted my parents about it. They claimed they did nothing wrong, that they paid for everything they needed to and the rest was not my business until their death. I felt they could have been more transparent with me, that their hiding it makes it seem like they don't trust me with the information. My sister agrees with them, but I think she has had an inkling about their net worth for a while now. She thinks that their responsibility to us was being good parents who meet our needs and set us up for success, which they did do, not denying that. But it also feels like they have not been honest with us. \n",

Anyways, all I wanted was to communicate that I don‚Äôt want to hear about my coworkers ‚Äútight butt‚Äù. He can say he loves her, loves her personality, but save the sexual comments for yourself. It makes me insecure to hear about his attraction to other women. I‚Äôve always been rated a 9/10, so to not be desired by my husband is already a huge slap in the face. In all of his intital anger at the mention of my insecurities, he threw his phone to break it but it hit his foot instead and broke his toe. It‚Äôs like, really broken. We put a splint on it and that‚Äôs the best we could do. \n",

We go and have some drinks and I‚Äôm having a great time. At one point my coworker that my husband really likes (his favorite) let‚Äôs call her Sally, decides she‚Äôs done and wants to leave. Her and her fianc√© take off. My other coworker, let‚Äôs call her Jane, and her boyfriend said they wanna go to a different bar with dancing about ten minutes away. I was very down to do this. We leave the bar and after my co-worker and her bf walk away, my husband says he has to pee and close the tab. We were already outside and I was feeling froggy and so I said ‚Äúnah screw it let‚Äôs just ditch this place and you can pee at the next bar. I don‚Äôt wanna pay the tab anyways hehe‚Äù and he immediately gets so mad at me and starts saying how cheap I am and that the tab is going to be closed by the bartender anyways, so there‚Äôs no skimping on the bill. I basically laughed and said ‚Äúwell I didn‚Äôt know that! Okay, let‚Äôs go back and you can pee.‚Äù We‚Äôre in my car at this point, about a minute walk from the bar we were just at.  He is so angry at me at this point for not just letting him go pee when he wanted to, that he starts screaming at me that I treat him like shit and this is exactly what he was talking about earlier, that I don‚Äôt care how I treat him, and I‚Äôm only concerned with myself and how I feel. I apologized in the moment and explained I didn‚Äôt realize he had to pee so badly, and that it would be fine to go back to the bar and pee really quick. I started to open the door as a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go!‚Äù type gesture, and he continued to scream at me that I don‚Äôt care about him. He jumped out of the car and walked away from it. I get out and beg him to come back and not do this tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Past context: He has gotten out of the car at stop signs before and ditched me, he takes off and leaves the house every time we fight, refusing to tell me where he‚Äôs going or for how long. It‚Äôs his pattern. The last time he did this I had to follow him around by car and foot for an hour. In the end, it‚Äôs always my fault, and I need to accept responsibility or he won‚Äôt forgive me. Half the time I don‚Äôt even know what I did wrong. He‚Äôll tell me I do this and that, but like, I am not intending to do the things he says I‚Äôm purposely doing to him. I really want to treat \n",
      "him right. I try. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I‚Äôm pissed that he walked away from the car, and my friends are en route to the other bar. My choices were, go after my angry husband in the cold and let him bitch at me about how awful I am, or go to the other bar where my friends are waiting and have a good time, and let my husband reap the consequences of his actions. Mind you, I have gone after him so many times. This is the first time I didn‚Äôt. I beg him to come back and talk it out once more, and then he yells back ‚Äúthanks a lot, you win again! I don‚Äôt even have a phone! Thanks a lot!‚Äù And I scream back ‚Äúcome and get your phone then! Please!‚Äù And he shouts back ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "So Im like fuck this and I go to the other bar and explain what happened. My friend insists I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong by not engaging in his game. I check my phone and I have a bunch of missed calls. I try calling every number back and I get no answer. I keep my phone close by for when he calls again so I can go get him. My friend advised I not go get him because it would reinforce that he‚Äôs allowed to act like this. I agreed with her but stated I can‚Äôt just leave him. \n",
      "\n",
      "I leave the bar and drive back to the other bar to look for him. He‚Äôs no where to be found. I drive home hoping he paid for a taxi. He wasn‚Äôt home. I‚Äôm so upset and angry I call his mother and explain what happened. She‚Äôs worried. She‚Äôs convinced he has manic bipolar disorder and that he needs to be on medication. She advises me to set an ultimatum that he either gets help by the end of the month or we‚Äôre legally separating. I never follow through on these ultimatums and it‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve tried a ‚Äúyou need help‚Äù approach. I go to sleep and wake up to a knock on the door at 5am. My husband walked 15 miles in the freezing cold all the way home. He basically doesn‚Äôt care about anything anymore and he hates me. I asked him if this is the end, since we‚Äôve been on the rocks for 7 months now, and been married for 12 months this month. He said that I‚Äôm the one that wants to end things and that why I‚Äôm treating him so badly. He said I abandoned him. I do feel badly that he walked in the cold but also, he had his wallet and could‚Äôve called a taxi. He could‚Äôve found a gas station and called me again. He had lots of options, but he chose to walk home. \n",

      "For context, I (17ftm) went to pride this weekend with my brother (15ftm). My father is transphobic/homophobic to the extreme so we're not out to him, and I knew he wouldn't let us go to the event if we told the truth. I was spending the night for two days in a hotel with friends, as was my brother. I told my mother all of the details, but the three of us mentioned nothing about pride when discussing it with my dad because we knew he would be pissed. So we went and had a great time - Except my mom got fed up keeping it a secret and ended up telling my dad everything. He got really angry with me specifically because he thought he could trust me and he was super pissed that I lied to him and made my mom lie. He said it felt the same as if she had cheated on him. He also said that it could've been dangerous and I had a responsibility to keep my brother safe. When he was done he went to his room and started to cry. Now I feel like a total dick for lying. But people have told me it was necessary. I don't know if I believe them. AITAH?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: Saw questions in the comments and wanted to clarify: I'm typically allowed to bring him places like that; I bring him to sleep overs with friends (the same ones we went to pride with) fairly often. To be fair, we don't often have opportunity to go to larger festivals or parades but we go pretty much everywhere together. I mentioned homophobia because my dad was specifically upset with me \"exposing\" my brother to a pride event, and how he trusted me with him only for me to take him to a pride festival, which my dad does not approve of.\n",

      "When we met he had to stay clean shaven for his job. Eventually he got another job and started wearing a short/trimmed beard, which I was fine with. I preferred him clean shaven, but the nicely manicured beard was an alright alternative. Lately he has started growing his hair out again (he does this every few years and donates his hair to Locks of Love). Now, I love when he grows his hair out because his hair is gorgeous (yes I‚Äôm jealous), all women and metalheads are jealous of his hair. However he always grows his beard out at the same time and says he doesn‚Äôt like being clean shaven with long hair.\n",

      "I HATE the beard. It is too long, too oily, too hot and sweaty! I hate kissing him with that beard! It just doesn‚Äôt look good! I‚Äôve told him time and time again that I‚Äôm just not attracted to him with that beard, and he should shave it if he wants me to find him sexy. He says I‚Äôm the AH and it‚Äôs his body to do with as he pleases. That‚Äôs fine, but I also don‚Äôt have to kiss or have sex with him while he has the beard, right?

When we first started dating Kim was very protective and secretive of her son, she told me she didn‚Äôt want to expose him to anyone until she knew that they were the right guy. When we were 9 months into our relationship she finally introduced me to her son call him Trey. Trey and I got along great and I really love that kid.  \n",

He was talking about my Trey saying that he is getting good at basketball like his dad. I was like oh can you tell me about Trey‚Äôs dad. And my brother in law laid out the whole story. Kim when she was in her sophomore year of college was seeing this guy call him Jay. Jay a D1 basketball player and was going to the NBA (in practice squad). Jay also had a fianc√© at the time. Kim did not care, and got herself pregnant with Jay‚Äôs baby. Jay gave her $300 for an abortion and to leave him alone.

She told me that I was being dumb and that me judging her for her actions in college is stupid and asked me all the dumb things I did back then. She then starts saying that it is the first time that Trey has had a positive role male model in his life and that I am not just blowing up our relationship but mine with Trey as well.

The fingering motion was very intense and went on for a few seconds and made me feel very awkward and uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt like being fingered so whoever was in his dream it definitely was not me.

      "So I recently broke up with my Lisa. We were dating for just over a year. We didn't live together, weren't engaged. I broke up with her to get married. I am from a different part of the world. In my country, it's customary that your family is involved in finding you a spouse. My mom had been trying to set me for five years now. I grew up in the US, finished high school here, went to college. I became an adult here. But I do remember my roots, I travel back home frequently and keep in touch with my culture. I always thought, I'd get married like Americans do. Meet a girl, fall in love, build a life together, like in the movies. I learned English by checking out DVDs from the library and watching them like 10x. That was my idea of America for a while. But as I got older, interacted with different kind of people, moved around the country, I slowly came to a realization that I don't really want to settle down with any girl that I've met.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think THE absolute worst part of America is undoubtedly the family dynamics. The way marriage works, the way parent-child relationships work. That's not the point of this post, but suffice it to say I disagreed heavily with American women on how to build a family. Lisa was no exception. I met her through mutual friends. She was very pretty, very outgoing. I asked her out, we hit it off and started dating. I knew from the start this wasn't a serious relationship. I never made any promises or tried to lead her on. We were two people, having fun. But I did want to settle down. I've been more receptive to my mom's suggestions in the past couple of years and a couple of months ago she found someone great (Bella)\n",
      "\n",
      "The way it works back home is that all the female relatives; grandmas, moms, aunts talk to their side and exchange information. Then they do sort of like an in-depth background check. Talk to neighbors, coworkers, classmates, whoever they can talk to. You know how studies show kids who see DV at home are more likely to do it themselves? We've been knowing this for hundreds of years. Girl's side usually asks if there's any trouble at home, does the guy get into fights, come home drunk stuff like that. Guys side asks about any late night excursions, how she treats the neighbors etc. Whatever the family is looking for, they talk to anyone they can to find out if they are a good match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well my mom and aunties asked around, she's great by all accounts. Cooks really well, does the chores at home, homebody, basically everything I could ask for. She very cute too. My mom really likes her mom too. We have a saying, pick your bride by her mother. Because all women end up like their mother (I don't know how true this is, but everyone does it this way.) I talked to Bella on FT couple of times. I really liked her, so I had to go back home to meet her in person, and if everything goes well, arrange a union. So I tell my boss that I'll have to work remotely for a few weeks, make sure all the bills are on AutoPay and break the news to Lisa. We met at her place, I told her that we want different things and we should move on. Lisa threw a fit. Non-stop crying, how could you, I thought you were different, why would you do this to me. I let her go on for a while, then said I was sorry and left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I didn't say anything else to her, but Lisa kept coming by my place, mutual friends kept messaging me. Why? How could you? She was ready to settle down. Well, the reasons are pretty simple. Lisa spent her college days jumping from guy to guy and getting very familiar with all the frat houses. After college, she had at least 4 relationships that I know of, and she was well known for getting over a guy by getting under...well you get the point. I didn't care about any of this because we weren't serious. I told all this to one of my good friends who is tight with her friend circle. Which was apparently news to her. As he tells it, she was ready to settle down with me. That's why she was taking it this hard? I made her no promises, had no intention of being serious with her and somehow I'm now being called an AH by all her friends. I thought this was the right place to ask AITAH?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Edit: Thank you Reddit, for your opinions, but clearly this isn't the place to ask. The reason I posted here was because I couldn't shake the feeling that Lisa and her friends might be trying to manipulate me. Because their response was so far removed from the arrangement we had. I was very clear in the beginning, that I was not ready for anything serious. I expanded in the comments how Lisa viewed this relationship too. We both understood that we were just having fun.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**But it wouldn't be Reddit, without automatically assuming guys are the AH. No, Lisa is now a poor love-struck girl who was mislead by the evil foreigner.

      "Okay, first i have to explain myself. My (22 F) s/o (23 F) of five years knows i'm all about big \"milestone\" events, the type of girl that dreamt about her wedding for days when she was little, the type of girl that tried designing her own quincea√±era dress because she wanted every single detail perfect, some call me crazy because it's the family, friends, stories, that matter right?, wrong !

      "Then it happened, she proposed...in our bedroom. We were cuddling and watching my fav show, she told me she wanted to ask me something and just did, i laughed cus i thought it was a joke and jus said something like \"yeah like you'll propose to me on our bedroom\", and she grabbed a pink box from the nightstand and showed me a ring. I couldn't say anything at that moment, she asked again and i just watched her, i asked her if she was serious and she told me that she was, that she wanted to spend her whole life with me.\n",

      "and i said no, this wasn't how i dreamed it would be so i cannot accept you here, i knew she wanted to cry but she tried to hold it, she just stood up and left the bedroom, i said that we should talk ab this but she just left, i heard her grabbing her keys and leaving the house, i think she is on her mom's house, she's not texting me back nor answering my calls, this happened some days ago and still cannot get in contact with her, her mom just told me to leave her alone to calm down, what do i do? am i the asshole for just trying to get the proposal of my dreams?\n",

      "I‚Äôve 22F know my boyfriend 27M for a year. We were FWB for six months then started dating for the last 6. When we were FWB, he was staying at my house a lot even if it was just to cuddle so we‚Äôve been close for quite a while. Once we did start dating and got more serious I asked him what he would do if I even got pregnant and he said ‚Äújump off a bridge‚Äù. I took it as a joke and an exaggeration of him really not wanting kids. I asked him the same on two other occasions because I wanted to have a serious conversation about it, especially since abortions were becoming extremely hard to get. His answer was always ‚Äújump off a bridge‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt want kids. I broke up with him over this. I told him that he could he could just get a vasectomy instead of saying messed up things to me. He told me that he wasn‚Äôt saying it to hurt me and didn‚Äôt consider how it made me feel. Pretty inconsiderate in my opinion. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said that I was right and that he would get a vasectomy. We stayed together because of that. It‚Äôs been over four months and he hasn‚Äôt pursued an appointment. I feel like he‚Äôs dragging his feet and only said he would do it so we would stay together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Quite often I‚Äôll think about what he said and be afraid to have sex with him because of the thought that he would rather kill himself than be a father. I am on birth control because I don‚Äôt want children either, but of course it isn‚Äôt 100% effective. I‚Äôm starting to feel more and more traumatized by what he said and don‚Äôt really want to have sex with him until he does get the vasectomy he said he would get. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every time I see him he complains about being horny. It‚Äôs made me want to see him less because I don‚Äôt want him to come around wanting to have sex but not putting any effort into getting the vasectomy. Hes nice to me, he pays for dates, and likes to spend time with me even without sex, but him saying he would do this one important thing and then not doing it is really bothering me. \n",
      "\n",
      "AITAH for not wanting to have sex with my boyfriend until he gets the vasectomy he said he would get after he told me he‚Äôd jump off a bridge if I became pregnant?\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm in being attacked for believing my boyfriend would do something he volunteered to do. It‚Äôs not like I said ‚Äú I‚Äôm breaking up with you unless you get a vasectomy‚Äù. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm breaking ups the you because you told me you would kill yourself if you ever got me pregnant. I don‚Äôt understand why you would say that to me when vasectomy is an option since you know for sure that you don‚Äôt want kids‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt give him an ultimatum. If I was the one saying I‚Äôd kill myself if he got me pregnant and he reminded me that abortion was an option, y‚Äôall probably wouldn‚Äôt be giving the same responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final verdict: apparently I‚Äôm the AH for expecting my boyfriend to follow through on his commitment to get a vasectomy. Although I didn‚Äôt ask him to get one, the fact that I no longer feel safe having sex with him apparently means I‚Äôm pressuring him to do what he said he would even though I never told him I‚Äôm going to withhold sex until he gets a vasectomy. We had sex a week ago. Anyways, when he does accidentally get me pregnant and kills himself, I hope you‚Äôll all be happy. Apparently getting a vasectomy is a way bigger decision than suicide. Apparently saying you‚Äôll commit suicide if you get your girlfriend pregnant is a funny joke that shouldn‚Äôt be taken serious when said multiple times. Apparently someone choosing ON THEIR OWN to get a vasectomy shouldn‚Äôt be taken serious either. I guess I will just pretend that my bf never told me he would get a vasectomy bc it was wrong of ME to believe he would because he said he would. I guess it‚Äôs okay to lie to your partner. Maybe I‚Äôll start lying to him by saying I‚Äôm on birth control when I don‚Äôt actually plan to get on it because it just a huge decision that could change my body and has so many side effects. Thank you all for your help in realizing every thing that comes out of a man‚Äôs mouth is just a joke and shouldn‚Äôt be taken serious.\n",

During my pregnancy my BD used to promise me we wouldn‚Äôt be homeless and we would have money because he‚Äôd be the one to get a job and I‚Äôd stay home and take care of our daughter. 6months into my pregnancy he finally gets a job because he was the one taking care of me the whole time. My pregnancy was hard due to having morning sickness 10times as bad as normal. But I pulled through. 1month after I gave birth my stupid auntie caused a seen and made everything about her self and my BD and I do not like her but we have to put up with her either way. She always has something to cry around about, anywho we got tired of her and we moved in with his mom, it was okay in the beginning until we decided to move back because it was shit over there, there was a big hole in the ceiling filled with mold an it would leak when it rains or snows and his mom didn‚Äôt seem to care, the iphone14 pro max was more important than fixing her ceiling I guess.\n",

And then again my auntie started things and made another seen and so we ended up staying at an extended hotel room. It sucked, we almost had to sleep in our car at one point and our car is shit and always breaks down. I was so lost. He wasn‚Äôt looking for a job but says he was.

I did my best to make it up to my mom and I figured my fianc√©e was just busy and she forgot. But there have been other incidents. My cousin got married recently. I know my fianc√©e was aware of the wedding because she talked about it, but I got a frantic call from my aunt wondering why we had not returned the RSVP and if we were even coming. I did tell my aunt we were going to the wedding but there is more tension now because we didn't bring a gift or buy anything from the registry. My fianc√©e never said anything and I didn't have any idea about this. One of my sisters was a bit upset we didn't bring a gift to the baby shower/barbecue my family threw for her too.

To use another example my fianc√©e is a mechanic. So of course she handles anything when it comes to making sure our vehicles are in good shape or fixed when they are broken. I do the things that I am strong with in our relationship. We are a unit and I thought that meant working together. I'm upset not only that she stopped but that she didn't even warn me. It not only made us look bad but people were hurt over it.

      "Last year she wanted to have sex and I really just didn't want to.  I got to the point where I didn't care if we ever had sex together again.  Obviously this has created a problem and she kept wanting to know what was my problem.  I wrestled with how to tell her, knowing that telling her would be a real blue to self esteem and could cause some damage .  After months of avoiding the topic, we got in an argument and I told her \"I'm just not attracted to you\" .  We have made some strides in talking about it and I alluded to the fact that she treats my family bad and she gained weight..... But I left out the lack of sexual chemistry. \n",

      "I feel like that would really kill her to know, but on the other hand I'm not being totally honest.  I figured it didn't matter of I said it, because it's not like you can change your chemistry, so I'm trying to save her feelings.  AITAH for not divulging this full information to her?\n",

My mom then said that it was impossible for Rebecca to be part of our family.\n",

      "He told Christa and me that perhaps he should consider dropping out of his MBA, but I told him that under no circumstances should he do that, and if he did, he would lose my support entirely.

      "I (30m) have been dating my GF (28f) for about 6 months now, and we've been exclusive for 3 of those. I've been falling head over heels for her. While she might not be the most physically affectionate, she's got a wicked sense of humor and a kind streak a mile wide. I've been thinking about what a future together would look like and up until this past weekend I liked what I saw. \n",
      "\n",
      "She was engaged once before and they broke up over a year ago. According to her they were going different places in life and the breakup was amicable because they both understood that they weren't the right fit anymore. She still hangs out with their mutual friend/gaming group and occasionally interacts with him. Since we started dating she's stopped talking to him unless there's someone else present. She returned most of his gifts to him but kept the games he has given her over the years. I'm not thrilled about that, but it is what it is. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last weekend I was at her place and we were on the couch while trying to figure out what movie to watch. She got up to get a blanket out of her office closet so we could wrap up and snuggle, and I went with her so we could continue talking. She opened the closet and I saw a wedding dress in a garment bag. It was huge and took up what seemed like half the space. I asked her if it was her dress from her previous relationship. She confirmed it and told me she kept it so she wouldn't have to go dress shopping again if she decides to get married again. I really could not tell if she was being silly or if she was deflecting. When we got back to the couch I asked her why she kept it if she's gotten rid of everything else, and she said she bought it and given how pricey it was she'd rather keep it and use it than sell it for a loss and have to buy another dress. She explained that when she bought it, she was more focused on a good ceremony rather than a good marriage. While I guess that makes sense financially, it doesn't sit right with me. That dress was supposed to be for him, for them. I don't think I'd be happy if I saw her wearing it down the aisle. \n",

      "I've been mulling it over and I am really beginning to wonder if she'll cheat on me with him in the future. She still has the dress that she was going to wear, she's still friendly with him. When I broke up with my GF I cut contact with her and her friends as I felt it was improper and I didn't want any future partners to feel uncomfortable. It was easier to get over her too. There are also too many stories about friends covering up cheating and I don't want that to be me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like the only way forward is if I ask her to get rid of the dress. To some people it might be just a dress but to me it feels like she's not over him and isn't willing to commit to our relationship fully. I want her to stop spending time with her gaming friends too but that seems like too big of a request for the moment. \n",

We were having sex once a month for over a year. I suggested looking into therapy, depression, hormone imbalance, all to which she said no. Then we had a 9 month dry spell, during which she told me 4 times to just find a mistress because she wasn‚Äôt interested in sex any more, but didn‚Äôt want to deny my needs. The 4th time I finally conceded, found a mistress. Asked wife if she wanted a paramour, she said no. Wife didn‚Äôt like that mistress was turning into a girlfriend so mistress was dismissed. Wife agreed to therapy and sex once a week. Wife quit therapy after 3 months, and here we are.\n",

My wife is not a sex machine that exists solely for my gratification and objectification, obviously.

      "I‚Äôm 35, my husband is 46. We‚Äôve been together 10 years and married 6. We‚Äôve had a relatively good marriage and relationship with no real issues aside from what I‚Äôd consider normal growing pains. I love him as a husband and a parenting partner and we make a damn good family. \n",
      "\n",
      "FWIW, We only got married because I was pregnant and, unsurprisingly, the state of TX makes it much more difficult at the time of birth if the parents aren‚Äôt married. He had a lot of tax issues prior to us meeting so the idea of legally tying ourselves together wasn‚Äôt a great one, and we‚Äôve been managing our finances and taxes independently ever since. We‚Äôve considered divorcing on paper because filing separately has been costly on the tax front, but never moved forward just because it never was a big enough deal for either of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for the real issue/question. We‚Äôre a one and done family, happy with our one kid and totally disinterested in having another. While we don‚Äôt want more children of our own, I LOVED being pregnant and would love the chance to experience that again without having to have another baby. I learned about gestational surrogacy about a year after having our son, and love the idea of helping someone else have baby, and would get to satisfy that desire for being pregnant and also make a pretty nice sized compensation that would make a significant impact to my family. I brought up the idea to my husband, and while he was a little unsure he never outright said no, so I continued on with the application process. I got pretty far into the approval, but when it came time for him to complete his psychological assessment, he failed, which means we couldn‚Äôt proceed. I was disappointed, but couldn‚Äôt fault him because he genuinely wanted to be on board, but had some questions and concerns that he couldn‚Äôt get past.  We agreed to table the conversation but both knew it wasn‚Äôt over because it was still something I really wanted to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past five years, I‚Äôve brought it up a few times and was always met with a really strong apprehension and it has been the only thing we‚Äôve consistently fought about. As the years pass, I‚Äôm nearing the end of my window to be approved, so when I brought it up again this April I‚Äôve been less willing to table the conversation. We saw a therapist to try to talk through everything but he was not happy with her approach and was very combative during our calls. She ended up basically firing him from therapy and said she‚Äôd be happy to continue to meet with me but it was obvious he was not there to have an open dialogue on the topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "During my additional conversations with her, she helped me to realize that this is a decision he can make for himself but not one he can make for me. I did not give up my bodily autonomy when I agreed to marry him and am not okay with him preventing me from using my body in the way I want. And as a result I asked my husband to move forward with a divorce so that I can proceed without him. In our conversations over the years we both talked about how frustrating it was that there wasn‚Äôt a compromise in this scenario, but I think the divorce is exactly the compromise we need.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not want our relationship to end and have no plans to change anything about our daily life, I just don‚Äôt want to be legally bound to him and give him the right to make decisions over me. We‚Äôve talked about divorcing for the tax reasons before so I honestly didn‚Äôt expect it to be a big issue, but he is really struggling with it. \n",

      "I filed a few weeks back and am in the waiting window before I can proceed with finalization, and it has been such a roller coaster as he moves through his feelings. \n",

We know we will have different boundaries based on what we are comfortable with - things that might make me uncomfortable may not make him uncomfortable and vice versa. This is not something we will break up over by any means, but simply something that I was reaching out about for compromises that have worked for others in the past. Of course I have insecurities, just like everyone, but I also know I am very attractive and he thinks I am the absolute bees knees. I feel as though it is natural for someone to not feel comfortable with their partner masturbating to another person and possibly imagining themselves being in the guys shoes ( ie fucking the other woman).

However, there is no intimacy outside of a little kiss here and there. We have only had adult time once throughout our entire relationship. He had me get rid of all of my adult toys, asked me to not have adult time alone, and refuses to do anything I suggest. Now I know there is a significant age difference, yet I have offered to pay for pills, doctor visit to make sure it's all functioning, offered different alternatives, but he refuses. He gets mad whenever I bring it up. He has stopped making me feel any type of confidence, I don't feel beautiful anymore, the last time we went out he gave me a quick complimet before rushing us out the door to get the night over with. Now I dont wear makeup often and only do when we go out. I know it's shallow of me to want more. My day to day life consists of waking up, showering, going to work (for 10 hours), coming home, cleaning, cooking, taking care of my pets, spending time with him and maybe watching TV, then showering again before bed.

I worry about her health because she started smoking at a very young age and I'm scared that she's gonna d13. So, I said that if she continues smoking I'm gonna cut myself. I said that it's literally the same we both harm ourselves. She said that it's an addiction and she just can't stop smoking all of a sudden. I don't know what I was thinking when I said that.

      "Here‚Äôs some backstory. I‚Äôve been with my husband, married for 2 years together for 9 yrs total. Before we were married he had a great amazing job with amazing hours and pay. Things were awesome and we saved for an incredible memorable wedding. However through the first year of our marriage, that great paying job screwed him over by starting to have him scheduled for 5a-8p shifts 6 days a week. Originally it was 5a-2p M-F, occasionally Saturdays(once a month). For a full year I barely saw my husband, let alone had time to spend with him since I also worked. I started to get attached to my coworkers who I thought were friends (turns out one of them were in love with me)- I would go out and hang with them often after or before work. Often times I‚Äôd hang out/hit the gym with this one male coworker, he was basically my assistant department leader (ADL) I was the department leader. My husband was aware of my actions but was uneasy about it. I told him we are all just friends ( I was oblivious to my ADL that ‚Äúloved‚Äù me) and you‚Äôre not home so I‚Äôd rather hang with people than be alone.. He understood. I told my husband if he could, try to talk with his managers about cutting his hours. The pay was more than enough at regular hours, but the business was understaffed. They were working him to the bone. Other staff would just leave when they wanted to and they wouldn‚Äôt be reprimanded. My husband would tell me the stories. So, I recommended then ‚ÄúWhy not just leave too, like at a reasonable time?  5a-5p so you could actually have time to relax at home and eat dinner and enjoy your downtime?‚Äù He said he would try, but it resulted in him receiving a warning. With that my husband chose to quit the job as was too much strain on our relationship. I was pursuing outside relationships rather than prioritizing one with my husband and it wasn‚Äôt worth it to my husband. Around the time he quit, my ADL confessed to me one night when we (my coworkers and I) were all out at the bars and I was shocked. I walked away from the situation and went home and told me husband and he exploded on me. Claiming he knew it, that I led my ADL on, that I pursued the friendship too far. So my question is, AITAH here‚Ä¶ essentially I told me husband to risk his job so that I didn‚Äôt have to feel the need to pursue other relationships‚Ä¶.\n",
      "Now, my husband is unemployed has been for months and he has anxiety and depression from everything that happened‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always covered main bills and he would cover his side of rent and his car notes. That‚Äôs it, he would usually buy us food and groceries or take us to a bar if we had the time.. but now-  he can‚Äôt pay for anything.. now he‚Äôs easily frustrated with me. I‚Äôve given him so much time and I‚Äôve talked to him so often about the situation, I‚Äôve been clear and honest as can be. Yet he gets this notion of paranoia that I‚Äôm going to leave him... \n",
      "Disclaimer: My husband knows I still speak occasionally with my ADL but I no longer work with him or hangout with him like I did before. I still treat him as a friend as I always had. My ADL also has a partner now.  So is my husbands‚Äô frustration, paranoia and anger validated? AITAH? Having to cover all our bills and trying not to pressure him too much or he gets upset.. what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs thoughts?..\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had a crush on this girl for a while knowing that she had a boyfriend. We started talking a couple months ago while she was still with him. She left her boyfriend for me only to find out that she was pregnant with his kid not to long after. I really want to be with her but want nothing to do with this kid. I don‚Äôt wanna get judged for being with a pregnant women and do not want to raise another man‚Äôs child. She does not want to have an abortion. I told her to have an abortion or I am gone. Am I the asshole? I feel bad about this but also feel like my feelings are understandable.\n",

      "My bf (17M) and I (18F) have been kind of dating for a couple months now. At first we mostly hungout irl but since I graduated and I work and hes in his last year we don't see each other much. Our relationship dynamic is very different than what I had with my ex. My ex did everything I wanted to do all the time and rarely told me no (his choice). Because of this, and the fact that we dated for over a year, I'm no longer used to not doing things that I want to. Now, I have no issue being told no and doing things he wants to do instead, I'm just trying to get used to it. However, I do have some issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "My love language is watching shows or movies with my partner, sleeping on call together, and just calling even if we stay silent. These were the things my ex was constantly happy to do with me. But my bf is the opposite. He doesn't like to call unless there's a purpose to, and we only sleep call a few days a week (though he's getting better at this). I understand that boundaries are good and that always saying yes isn't healthy. I'm glad he's not constantly giving in. But it's gotten to the point where we rarely ever do what I want to. I'm talking watching shows one day a month, a week if I'm lucky. \n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, getting to the title, he recently told me that I make him feel bad whenever he says no to watching something with me. He says it's how I react. I'm not a very verbal person, so when I'm upset I change my tone, I text differently, and you can tell by my mood. He's upset because I act that way every time he says no (which is a lot). My whole thing is, I wouldn't get upset by him saying no if he would just say yes every now and then. I would literally be happy with one day a week. One day a week to watch movies or shows together. And it's not like there's no time, he just \"doesn't feel like it\". I understand not being in the mood, but sacrificing a little to watch a show with your partner to make them happy isn't gonna kill you. I want to bring this up to him but I've already tried before and here I am. \n",
      "\n",
      "So AITAH for being upset with him over this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Extra: I've also tried finding things that we both enjoy. He actually enjoys the shows and movies that we do end up watching, hes just never in the mood to watch them. We try playing games together but I don't enjoy the type of games he plays, and though he likes the games I play, he doesn't enjoy them \"enough\". We watch YouTube together with no issue, except it's mostly YouTubers and videos that HE likes, and barely ones that I like. In person I'm able to convince him to watch the things I enjoy watching, but we watch an episode or two and that's it. It feels like our relationship is primarily for his s//ual enjoyment at this point. And I hate saying that because I know he loves me. Idk, it's just irritating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: some of y'all need to read better because it's honestly irritating how many of you think I'm some entitled brat who craves attention. As I stated previously, I work, he has school, and we barely hangout irl anymore. I am perfectly okay with spending time apart, and I'm okay with doing things that he wants to do. HOWEVER, my entire point is that it would be NICE if we could compromise enough to do something I enjoy at least ONE DAY a week. 1% is all Im wanting. I don't understand how that's so scandalous to some of you. And I'm not throwing a fit when he says no either I just say okay I understand and move on with a slight change in tone. I also don't understand how sleep calling is \"psychotic\" behavior. Its just comforting and again as mentioned, he has told me that he sleeps better on call, we just don't do it often. Hope this helped.\n",

      "Some context I run a company with about 15 employees. 9 men and 6 women not including me and my business partner.

It always poops in my yard and it‚Äôs becoming a problem.  I tried to explain the situation in a civil manner with John, but he would not listen.  He just told me to ‚ÄúScrew off,‚Äù or to ‚ÄúStop being such a douche man,‚Äù and finally ‚Äú ‚ÄúIf you hate the crap to much pick it up yourself bro.‚Äù  His snarky remarks was mildly infuriating but I lost it when my three-year-old daughter was playing in the yard and tripped on the poop and got it in her eye.  She caught an eye-infection from this.  I told John about the issue and he just laughed and said some snarky remark.  This lit a devious spark in me that I didn‚Äôt even know existed.  The next day early in the morning before John was awake I went to his doorstep and took off my pants.  I bent over and took a massive hate-crap on his doorstep to teach him a lesson.  Like this was the most foul crap I have taken in my life.  Later that day, John knocks on my door and screams countless obscenities at me.  I responded with one of the same snarky remarks he had told me and I slammed the door in his face.  My wife told me that I took it too far but I think that taking a dump on his doorstep was what the kid needed to get my point across.  So AITA?\n",

      "In one of her classes, they had a discussion/reading about maternal mortality and she's been obsessing over it ever since.

      "Yesterday we went to the doctor for an ultrasound and though she seemed pleased to know the sex of our kid, Sarah spend a huge chunk of the time asking questions about her own body and making sure everything was alright about herself.

I don't think I'm being unreasonable--most parents put their kids over anyone else, including themselves. AITAH?\n",

      "So I went out to a strip club for the first time ever this weekend and I ended up getting a dance at the end of the night. By this time I was absolutely wasted. I was enjoying the dance and at first it was cool and she told me I could touch her so I had my hands on her boobs. As she continued to dance at a certain point this dancer grabbed my penis and said \"good?\" And I said yes because I was enjoying the dance and I didn't think anything of her asking good other than am I enjoying it. Then she pulled my penis out and again was throw off by it but I just let it go she kept dancing and got on top and slipped my penis in and for a minute or so she road me. Again I was wasted and didn't ask her to do this. So I feel I did not consent to this. I realized this wasn't okay and had her stop. I left the strip club right after that and went home. I must add I have a girlfriend and I felt completely horrible about this. She knew about the strip club and encouraged the idea of a dance before I went to the club because it was my first time and she was supportive of that. It took me a couple days to wrap my head around what happened and about what I was going to tell my girlfriend because I felt she needed to know. (We don't live together) so I didn't see her for those couple days. I did tell her when I saw her and she was upset and says she wants to believe me but she isn't sure because she says that that kind of thing never happens.

      "\n",
      "Me and my dad have always cared very well about our health. My dad pushed us to exercise regularly, and I do so with him and we always have a good time, and feel pumped afterwards. He also pushed us to have healthy diets, take vitamins, etc. Not in a bad way, but he always tried to lead me and my sister in the right direction, and it worked on me since I follow very healthy habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister, however, has never listened to our dad regarding any of this. She would always brush him and I off, saying she's fine, and at times she'd even blow up screaming at us, calling me the \"favorite child\" and our parents \"emotionally abusive\". Our dad indeed tried to push my sister a little more to get into a healthy lifestyle, but that was because my sister had dangerously high cholesteral due to genetics (inherited from our mom) so of course he would be much more concerned about her health than mine. So I would actually argue that she would've gotten more attention than me, since our dad was so worried about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll admit that I thought it was very selfish of my sister to not try to be a little healthier for the sake of our dad being a little more at ease.

      "Anyway, onto the main event. Recently, my sister fell of a small cliff (around 30-40 ft in height) and fractured both of her legs, but her right leg was the most damaged. Her right leg had an open fracture, meaning her broken bone actually broke skin, and because it took a bit for the ambulence to get there, my sister's leg got infected very badly, and they had to cut off the 1/4 of the bottom of the leg so that the infection couldn't spread anywhere else.\n",

She was saying how she could never walk hikes, would never be able to go on runs, etc. Which normally I'd say is normal but she literally never has done any of that stuff. She hates hiking, she hates going on walks, she literally sits all day in her room on her computer and hardly comes out (even before part of her leg being amputated). I tried to ignore this, but she kept saying these things, and now including sports, something she has always hated.\n",

      "She. Lost. It. She grabbed stuff and threw it around her room and yelled at me until I left.

They said that what I said was way out of line, and it wasn't the \"right time\". And now they aren't speaking to me at all. They said they wouldn't until I apologize to my sister. \n",

      "Me (26f) and my bf (28m) have been together for almost 2 years now. The sex life is good, but hasn't been great. We've spiced up here and there and its going in the right direction. I've opened up about a couple of my kinks and we've tried them out with success, so I really wanted to push him about his. I am pansexual and my previous relationship was with a woman. In that relationship I would typically be the top and in general the more dominant. We talked about this a bit the other night and he made a comment about how I would have loved in college. Of course I love him now but in the context of the convo I pressed him. He admitted to me that in college he experimented with gender roles and his sexuality, specifically crossdressing. I got so excited and already started planning our girls night but he pushed back. He said hes a different person now and grew out of the phase in his life. I started asking him more questions and what the biggest fantasy he had at that time. It went a lot deeper than just crossdressing and was more like femdom, which I was really interested in trying with him. \n",
      "\n",
      "I pushed him for a about a week before he agreed to experiment with me. I got so excited and wanted to make it the best experience for him so I ordered a bunch of stuff for him like clothes, lingerie, shoes in his size, wig, kinky items like restraints, plug, strap-on, chastity cage, etc. We both agreed that if we were going to do it we had to do it right so I had him remove all his body hair, plucked his brows, did his nails, everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I finished his makeup and got his wig on and dressed it was pretty shocking. He looked so pretty!! Like actually very hot it felt like a completely different person. We just started with drinking wine and chatting. I still couldn't believe this was the man I loved, hearing his voice come out of a pretty woman's mouth was jarring. I told him to try and feminize his voice a bit, acting like it was kinky, but in reality I was getting a little uncomfortable. His slight voice change actually helped and we kept on with our girls night. I told him to put on some porn for us to watch. The video was interesting it was like a trance music video with different clips of crossdressers and trans girls having sex with men. I didn't mind however what caught me off guard was him making comments about the men and their bodies, how good it must feel, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "When it came time for sex I had him put on some fetish wear and model it for me. We also did a sub/domme dynamic where he had to earn release from a chastity cage. He was 100% submissive and wanted to be referred to by female pronouns. We did some light kink like humiliation and spanking before I pegged him. He seemed to enjoy himself a lot. I didn't mind it but it was still jarring seeing the man I love like this. \n",
      "\n",
      "I made sure to do a lot of post care because I can tell this was an intense moment for him. He was happy and thankful that I allowed him to open up. At the time I felt sort of neutral, but leaning towards not wanting to incorporate it into our sex life. I didn't want to take the wind out of his sails immediately so I decided to wait a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later I popped into his apartment to drop something off before I went out of town for work and he had a full face of makeup and a stack of Amazon boxes. He greeted me completely normal and said he was trying on some new stuff he ordered. He begged me to stay so he could do a fashion show but I said I was just dropping by real quick. He then sorta tried to seduce me and show me he was wearing the chastity cage and anal plug I got him. I agreed to a \"quickie\" but it was just me using a toy on him. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I got back from my work trip a few days later he picked me up and everything seemed normal. I told him to stay at my place that night. We went to bed and started getting intimate. I noticed his body was still hairless and his toenails were still painted. After we finished I asked him about it and he said that he might as well keep things that way. I was slightly confused until he started showing me pictures and videos he took of himself crossdressed from when I was out of town. He was super excited to show me the new outfits and makeup looks he tried. Again I didn't want to take the wind out of his sails and played along. \n",
      "\n",
      "Things have been normal for the most part since then, but it seems like hes incorporating his kink into his everyday life now. Even though I was the one who pushed him to explore it again I feel like I've lost all attraction to him. I still love him and his feminine side, but it now it feels like the love I have for my platonic girlfriends. I tried to give it some time but I just can't some of the images out of my head. Its like I don't see him as the man I love anymore. I miss having that masculine energy complimenting me. I am going out of town again soon and I'm filled with anxiety about what he is going to do when I'm gone. Part of me just wants to end thins and tell him we can be \"girl friends.\" I know its a big decision after two years but I don't see myself going back to how I felt before. I feel guilty because  I'm the one who pushed him even after he said he had grown out of it. \n",

Her reasoning is that she had spent a lot of effort to get name recognition in her field and taking my name is an archaic tradition.  I could take hers if I wanted.  I point out that my name is very unique (think Viklander) and her name is the equivalent of Johnson or Smith.  It wouldn‚Äôt take long for people to recognize her under the new name. I also point out that she‚Äôs had a very long time to bring this up.  We've past the point of easily backing out.  What if it was a deal breaker for me?

She had already put her number one name as the first name, her grand fathers last name as the middle (actually a pretty cool middle name but never on the list) and her last name as our son‚Äôs last name, not mine as we had agreed.  I was stunned.  I offered that we could use her last name as a middle name as a compromise.  She offered to use mine as a middle name or maybe hyphenate mine with hers (think Vicklander-Johnson).  I said no, that‚Äôs a dumb  name and not what we agreed to.  She said that she was the one who gave birth and she‚Äôs decided she gets to pick the name.

My stepdad reminds me that I came into his life after my father had died and he‚Äôs loved me like his own and we have different names, and it doesn‚Äôt matter to either of us.  He says it's only an issue if I let it be.  Kate, my wartime consigliere, is not happy with Cami.  She thinks it's all bullshit.  But, she tells me to think the options through and where they end up.  She says to try to talk it out with Cami.  Maybe she‚Äôs not thinking clearly. But if Cami won‚Äôt give in, an option would be to go to court over it, but she didn‚Äôt think that I had better than a 50% chance of winning, and it was more likely that things would escalate, and we‚Äôd be in divorce court soon after.

We both want more children (one for me, more for her), but I'm not going to have any more children if all my children don't have my last name.  Sorry if that makes me a trad dad.  She's known this was a deal breaker since before we were engaged and had explicitly agreed before we married.  If she wants to have more children with me, then she needs to do the legwork to get our son's name changed to what we had agreed.

      "I, 18 female originally had no problems with dogs, I didn't like them nor hate them, and I usually tolerated them being around. However, when I was about 14 yo, this all changed. We had a small house that barely fit our family (and that's saying something considering that my family only had 3 members counting myself and my parents). My mother was a dog lover while my father was not. It wasn't that he hated dogs, it was just that he never cared about them and just tolerated them. At first, everything was fine, we had 3 dogs and they were very well taken care of. We placed the dogs near our owned transient house. However, the dogs became a problem for the people renting the transient house. Soon enough, various complaints were released about the dogs, the noise, and everything. It was to the point where it was ruining the business. The place was rated so low, almost nobody wanted to go and rent the place. My father, who was a businessman, immediately noticed the problem and demanded from my mom how she needed to lessen the number of dogs. My mother who absolutely loved the dogs disagreed and said that she wanted to keep them.\n",

Their relationship quickly turned sour, to the point where both of them couldn't even go on for a day without arguing about something. The last straw was when my mother went back home holding a dog, apparently, she pitied the dog and wanted to find a perfect house for the dog. I knew it was a lie, and so did my father. We both knew that she took the dog because she wanted to keep it. She told my father how she wanted to move our other dogs to our house instead, along with the dog she picked up \"while she was waiting for someone to adopt the dog\". My father disagreed because our house was small and the dogs aren't exactly small dogs. This turned into a big argument, it got so bad my mother demanded a divorce from my father. My father who wanted a whole family asked me to give my opinion on it. They explained themselves and why they have the opinions they currently have. I, of course, gave my honest opinion to them and told them that I also believed the dogs were really becoming a problem. My mother was livid, she cried, screamed, and told me how I had no idea how dogs gave light to her life and how I was acting like my father whom she believed was a monster. Since then she started acting cold to me and my dad. She was no longer the same warm and loving mom I grew up with. It affected me really badly, and I started blaming dogs for what happened in my family. I knew I was being petty for hating the creatures who had nothing to do with what happened with my family but I still couldn't help but blame them. I didn't want to see them, and even though my mind knew I was being absolutely ridiculous, I still couldn't help but hate them.

I'd like to say I've always been pretty liberal in my views of sex work; it's work. Even then, she said she probably wasn't comfortable doing nudity to start off.

      "Hi,(30 F) and my boyfriend (28 M) have been dating for a little over 2 & 1/2 years. I pay a mortgage on a small home I bought prior to COVID-19 while  my boyfriend lives at home with his parents. My boyfriend dated his ex wife for 1.5 years before they got married. The marriage itself lasted 11 months and ended with him moving back home with his parents and his ex-wife keeping the house.\n",
      "Our relationship started 7 months later. \n",
      "\n",
      "We did have a lot of bumps in the relationship with both of us being stubborn and strong-headed individuals; we have great chemistry and are both really strong family-oriented people.  I do love him but a part of me resents the fact he has been married before when I have not. I can sense when a man is desensitized from a subject and the subject of marriage has never formally been brought up by him.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe I am not the one for him because he clearly had no problem going for it with his first wife and has not done that with me. I find it really insulting to accept second place to an ex wife at anything regarding my future husband.  I hated the fact that I could potentially be a second wife, but when the same man takes two or three times longer to decide on me is just not acceptable. I feel like a dunce in all of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not the type of woman who wants to deliver an ultimatum that ends in an engagement so I broke up with my boyfriend. His ex-wife is now remarried, as me and her ex-husband were working hard, talked about buying land and building a house. I made it known that I will not sell my house to live with him just as my boyfriend. I wanted some form of commitment made prior and he agreed that and that was over a year ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like we missed out of some great opportunities because he keeps stalling and using side-work to stay busy instead of like putting in work to be in a partnership with me. I dropped hints and said I really wanted to be engaged before 30 ( this would mean in a relationship for 2 years). You know it, my birthday came and went this past year and I was bummed out. \n",

      "I 28F used to be part of a group of five best friends when we were in High School: Lana, Chris, Sarah, Rebecca and I (all 18 at the time). We all were inseparable, but I had a nemesis inside this group: Rebecca. \n",
      "Rebecca has always been beautiful, fit and photogenic, and I always found this annoying of her. What I hated more, however, was that everyone in the group preferred her over me. She was kind and threw surprise birthday parties to everyone, me included, and her fake attitude made me vomit. Rebecca always knew what to say to help, to be a good friend, while I was only good at starting fights that OF COURSE Princess Rebecca won or ended. And she was strong willed, so when I tried to take over she would put me right where I came from. I never hated her, but I wished her death many times. The worst part, however, was that I always viewed her as my nemesis, when Rebecca never even considered me as a threat. It chewed me alive all our teen years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Rebecca introduced us to Nolan (at the time 20M), her friend. I liked him immediately, but he started dating Lana. I was not going to take that again, not from Lana, Rebecca‚Äôs naive, way too dark and stupid ‚Äúplatonic soulmate‚Äù, so when Lana left for a week I started hanging out more with Nolan. Chris, Sarah and Rebecca told me to stop ‚Äúflirting‚Äù because he was dating Lana, but I didn‚Äôt care about their distorted point of view. He left for vacations and Lana came back, and she and Rebecca left for a vacation. When they left Nolan came back, we ended up sleeping together. The next morning Nolan called Rebecca, and she was ready to kill me for hurting poor little Lana. When they came back Lana broke up with him. She did forgive and stayed friends with us despite those three snakes wanting to kick me out.\n",
      "Nolan and I began dating, but I must‚Äôve made them jealous, because the more I got with Nolan and I didn‚Äôt hung out with them, the less they called me. Rebecca tried to talk to me and do ‚Äúinterventions‚Äù with her saint behavior but I never cared, to shut her up I always said I would‚Äôve done better but never did. Like, why did I have to change just because miss perfect wanted it? Then I noticed they were hanging out without me. I went to them multiple times to get back with them, but every time they started ignoring me again. It went like this until we went NC after graduation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 years later, when were all 21, I broke up with Nolan and I realized I had no friends, because my only friends ignored me for no reason. Chris, Sarah, Lana and Rebecca were all still in contact with each other without me, and it made me extremely sad. I contacted them and although they were skeptical, when we met I told them how sorry I was, and I also faked that Nolan manipulated me to never make me stay with him all those years, an innocent lie to get them back, really. Sarah and Chris believed me, but Rebecca and Lana were still skeptical. We hung out together again. At that point I thought Rebecca had changed and become more tolerable, but I was wrong. She was in time with the exam, had an amazing life and a beautiful half Italian boyfriend, Tony. I had none of those things, so I made a plan to take revenge of Rebecca and make her pay for being obnoxious. One night Tony was angry at Rebecca, and since I remembered that Rebecca wished to save herself for marriage, I asked Tony if they had sex. They didn‚Äôt. I was even more mad at Rebecca for being so selfish, so I told Tony that it wasn‚Äôt fair for him to be without sex, and that if Rebecca loved him she would‚Äôve already given him her V card. Needless to say, we did the do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Rebecca showed up with the others at Tony‚Äôs apartment and found the two of us. Rebecca screamed like a maniac at Tony for cheating, and Tony lied and said that it was me that seduced him and told him about what I said the previous night. Rebecca turned to me and launched herself at me, hitting me and screaming all possible insults. The other three had to take her off of me. Tony tried to talk to her, but she smacked him in the face and told him that they were done, took her things and left. Tony kicked me out after that. The four snakes blocked me everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "In present time I was at a restaurant and saw Rebecca with a man. I went up to her, and we held a civil conversation, then I tried to introduce myself friendly to the man, but he just glared at me and told me he already knew who I was. I assume those snakes told him lies about me. That night, I stalked Rebecca and discovered that she and the guy married a year ago. I looked at the photos and I lost it. I discovered her address and the next day I went to her house and entered as soon as she opened the door. I started crying and telling her how hurt I was that she excluded me from her wedding after all these years of friendship. She told me I was still the jealous 14yo from high school. I tried to slap her out of anger, but her husband came out of nowhere and pushed me before I could do anything. He started shouting at me to get out of their house and called me horrible names.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was yesterday. That afternoon Lana, Sarah and Chris wrote me for the first time in years just to say mean things to me on how horrible I was, because that snake surely told them a distorted version of what happened, omitting how her husband gave me PTSD.\n",

When my wedding day came around she saw that her sister was pregnant and my fianc√© congratulated her and asked where the father was.

He had to go in a different direction but said that I needed to zip up my jacket. In his defense, I didn‚Äôt take him seriously and after we got in our second periods, he texted me and said to zip my jacket up and that I was showing too much cleavage. Again, I didn‚Äôt take him seriously and I let my friend use my phone to text him just to mess with him a little.

      "At the end of a rare date night, I asked if we could talk about the relationship. The conversation began ok, but ended really badly‚Äîwith me saying some hurtful things. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, she proposed taking a break. This wasn‚Äôt the first time in the last month or two where she has proposed taking a break. She explained needing a break from me because she felt judged by me about her friendships; she said she wanted to go do things like take shrooms, get more tattoos and go dancing without having to worry about me; and she also said that she wanted space to go flirt and have sex with other people. I was devastated. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have been together for six years in October, and we‚Äôve had issues with sex for roughly 80 percent of that time. This has included extended dry spells, me not initiating, her and I both admitting at various points to having had better sex lives with our exes, her having a fibroid that caused a low sex drive for years (at one point I asked if she might be asexual), and my not being understanding about her previous history with a sexual assault/rape (which, short story, was me asking if she had hooked up with a groomsman at her best friends wedding in the past because they were being very flirty and dancing together that night and it made me uncomfortable. Turned out they might have, but she said she wasn‚Äôt sure and that he likely drugged and raped her. I questioned why she would still be dancing with him then and putting herself in positions to hang out with him. This, I‚Äôve since learned, is not ok and insensitive). \n",
      "\n",
      "In recent months, she‚Äôs gotten her sex drive back, but I haven‚Äôt been initiating. She also said that I haven‚Äôt been making her feel wanted or desired. Truth is, she was right. \n",

      "This is where it gets interesting: About a month ago, she started going to a bathhouse. She‚Äôs a social person, and it‚Äôs a big part of what she says her identity is. So she tends to ‚Äúbuild community‚Äù wherever she goes. So she started making friends at the bathhouse‚Ä¶which struck me as odd, but  maybe it‚Äôs not, I‚Äôve never been to one. One day, she told me about all these people she‚Äôd met including a ‚Äújacked former basketball player.‚Äù Turns out, while we were growing apart, she was getting to know this guy‚Äîa 6‚Äô7‚Äù personal trainer in his 40s that used to play basketball.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the argument where she proposed taking a break, she said that someone had been paying attention to her and it made her feel wanted and good. It was the jacked guy from the bathhouse. I asked if she wanted to explore things with him, but she couldn‚Äôt really give an answer. We fought about this for about a day and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, I asked if we could remain together and she could go flirt and have sex with other people, which she said would make it so that she could get past her sexual hang ups with me (basically if she could go have wild, uninhibited sex with someone else, she could come back to do that with me). She said I could go do the same and explore whether or not I really wanted to be with her. To me, it sounded like she really just wanted to go be with the guy from the bathhouse. She mentioned that this arrangement might look like possibly sleeping over at his house (because she really likes morning sex), wanting to get dinner and drinks, etc. So I told her I would be ok with her getting it out of her system if it was just sex. But I couldn‚Äôt really get her to say that it was just sex‚Ä¶so I got more and more dejected. \n",
      "\n",
      "After that conversation, I arranged to go on a lunch date with someone a few hours before she was to go see the guy from the bathhouse at their usual meetup time. I went on the coffee date. The woman and I had a fun time chatting, but there was nothing there. When I came back home from the date, my partner was upset. But she eventually went to the bathhouse, hung out with the guy again, and came home (they didn‚Äôt go out for dinner, drinks or sex, which talked about might be a possibility). \n",
      "\n",
      "She told me that while she didn‚Äôt think he was the type of person she wanted to date, that there was still an attraction there. I told her that that sounded like she was developing intense feelings and it was a boundary for me. We disagreed on what constitutes flirting, why he might/should still be a friend of hers, and we continued to discuss why she needs to go have sex with other people in order to have good sex with me (but she has to develop an attraction to the person first, which is why she thought this guy might be the person to do that with). \n",
      "\n",
      "I eventually said I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with continuing seeing him for a number of reasons. \n",
      "\n",
      "Am I the asshole for saying that I don‚Äôt want her to continue seeing this guy? Am I the asshole for not being ok with her having sex with other people to have a better sex life in the future?\n",

      "I'm a single mom of 2. I have beautiful little girl and boy. It's really hard to meet decent men dating as a single mother. I thought I got a good one in my ex, Mike.

      "Last weekend we was supposed to go out. My sitter was running late when Mike pulled up. I told him to come in, because I still had to finish getting ready. Mike came in just as I gave kids dinner. Literally like 2 minutes later, my daughter spilled juice and got most of it on herself. Like almost the entire carton. When I came in, Mike was getting napkins. I told him that she'll just get sticky. I was going to give her a quick bath, but I got a call from my BD, finally. I needed to talk to him about our kid so I asked Mike if he would give her a quick bath. \n",

      "He got all shocked and asked if I was serious. I said yeah, and then we can go as soon as the sitter gets here. He said what is wrong with you and bounced. Within like 2 seconds. He texted me, you might as well cancel the sitter. Now he not replying to my calls or texts. I told my girls and they was saying I'm the crazy one to ask a random man to bathe my daughter. I feel like I've known him enough to trust him, but because his mind immediately went there maybe he is a POS.  Like if you a normal guy you wouldn't even think about it like that. AITA here?\n",

Her best friend and the one who will be the MOH is a guy she has known from diapers. Her mom and his mom were besties in HS and when they m hand babies their baby's became besties. My issue is the title. MAN of honor. Now it being my wedding too I am the Man of honor,  the groom, the big cheese, if you will. I just don't think having a man of honor sounds right. I would be okay with Person of honor. When my sister got married her husband's best friend was a female the one who actually brought them together. She stood up on his side as the best person nor best woman because the title of Best woman seemed disrespectful to the bride. I feel Man of Honor is disrespectful to the groom.\n",

      "There's a lot of context to go into this one; about a year ago my friend (F 34), we'll call her Sadie, and her husband (M 38), we'll call him Mike, got into a fight, and he acted in a way that felt violent and made her feel unsafe. He scared her. He's never physically assaulted her, but he has made her feel scared on numerous occasions, and caused emotional trauma, so Sadie decided to leave him that night. She packed her bags, and moved to her brother's house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year, they've gone to couples therapy to try to work things out, and then they started to go to therapy individually because they realized they had their own issues. It started to become clear a few months down the road that they probably weren't going to get back together. Mike had been sober since before him and Sadie got together, but recently started drinking and doing drugs again. He also started kind of seeing someone, but it looks like that's over now. I think it took about 8 or 9 months before Mike started going down this road, it seemed like he was trying to work things out with Sadie for maybe the first 6 months, but then became disheartened when Sadie decided to split their finances up and move to an apartment of her own. I'm just getting the outside perspective, so I might not be getting all the timelines right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike and my husband, we'll call him Toby, are friends.  My husband motivates Mike to workout, eat healthy, and is a good influence on him. Mike has also only ever been kind to us, and has been helping us with our house renovations over the past year since he's a contractor by trade (we pay him for his work too). My husband and I are trying to finish our house renovations asap, as we want to have the house ready for whenever we decide to have children, and I'm 29, so the clock is ticking. However, we are not planning on having kids for another 2 years. I am friends with Sadie more than I'm friends with Mike, as I like to think of myself as more of a girl's girl, and I've been doing my best to be emotionally there for Sadie over the past year because separating from Mike has been really hard on her, obviously. However, Toby and Mike are good friends, so Toby's loyalty is more with Mike.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here's the issue, Mike is going to be kicked out of his place that he's renting (from his parents) in the spring, and he's not sure where he's gonna live yet. He has some debt I think too. And the housing market isn't great here. \\[edit\\] The reason his parents want him out of that house is because Mike can't really afford it anymore since he and Sadie used to split the cost of it. I think he's still made all of his rent payments so far. His parents really just want to sell their current house and downsize to the house that Mike used to share with Sadie. Which means that Mike has 6 months to find a new place to live. \\[edit\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband brought up the idea that, since we just finished the guest bedroom and guest bathroom recently, Mike could maybe stay with us until he gets back on his feet (we would cap it at 6 months max), and we could figure out an arrangement where Mike pays less rent to us depending on work he does for us around the house to help speed renovations along. We might even end up paying him, depending on how much work he did. we haven't figured this out yet since it's still a new idea. We want our main upstairs bathroom done, for example. And he's already expressed an interest in helping with that. So having him stay with us seems like it could be a win-win situation for us, and for Mike. But not for Sadie. I told my husband that I wanted to talk to Sadie about potentially having Mike move in with us before agreeing to anything, and today I reached out to her via text. I basically said \"hey, I want to keep you informed on what my husband and I are thinking about doing. We think it could help Mike, and seems like the right thing to do since he doesn't really have anywhere else to go once he's kicked out of his place\" And I gave her more info about how it would work and stuff with the compensation. She responded and said it seems like \"I don't believe how violent and scary Mike can be, and he's got those addiction issues\", and she feels like we would be putting ourselves in danger if we had him come live with us. I support her, and I believe she had every reason to feel unsafe living with Mike, but I feel like since my relationship with Mike isn't as intimate as theirs was, I wouldn't actually be in danger. Plus, I don't really think he would physically do anything, since he never has, and I think we would be a good influence on him with keeping him accountable for his sobriety. I wouldn't be keeping him accountable, to be clear that would be my husband. I don't plan on treating Mike as anything more than a roommate, really.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, all I've done is tell Sadie it's something we're considering. I told her we have not decided or guaranteed anything to Mike yet. There's still a 50/50 chance of yes or no. We're still debating it, and praying about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Sadie is debating stepping back from our friendship because we're thinking about doing this. She has every right to do what makes her feel comfortable, but I'm saddened that she would want to end a friendship with me because of this. Should I tell my husband that we shouldn't have Mike stay with us because I don't want to lose the friendship with Sadie? Should us offering Mike a place to stay depend on Sadie at all? What should we do?\n",

      "\\[UPDATE\\] We decided not to have him stay with us. Thank you to those people who were kind and gave a thoughtful answer, rather than just dismissing real people in black and white terms. This is a very complicated situation, and many of your answers gave me a lot to think about. Sadie and I are fine. I told her our decision and we both understand why I brought it up in the first place (to be transparent). We're meeting up later this week to debrief. Ultimately, I wanted to be there for the victim, not my husband's friend. But I hope he finds a good place to get his footing back. He was sober for 8 years up until a couple months ago so I think he can get back to it. \n",

      "I (f) have been dating T (m) for 2 months after over a year of being single following a painful divorce. T has a teen son at home. I have no children. I travel for work and have learned that I get better service when I eat alone if I sit at the bar. I live in a rural area and have become a regular at a restaurant/bar closest to my home. I've been going there for a couple years and have lots of friends - both male and female - that randomly show up for drinks and a chat. It's like my Cheers. I have never dated anyone from the bar and I'm usually home by 7pm. It's not a hookup joint!\n",

      "Prior to our first date, I told T that I go there twice a week and hang at the bar. I said it was may place and I wasn't ready to bring him there - YET.

Later that night we spoke on the phone and he said he had been there and watched me with my friends. I was so thrown off that I ended the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel betrayed because he went to the restaurant without telling me after I was clear with him that it was my spot. He has several other dinning options, so there's no valid excuse for him to have been there. It feels like he was spying and is distrustful of me even though I haven't done anything to deserve that. If he had said he wanted a private dinner with his son and I showed up at the same restaurant and watched them, I'm sure that would be considered creepy and crossing a line.\n",

I was so excited to tell him and it makes me feel good to do these things because I am a SAHM and I feel like my life does revolve around our daughter 24/7. Anyway, when I told him he wasn‚Äôt excited or appreciative at all. He was just saying things like ‚Äúwhy‚Äôd you do that?‚Äù And ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to spend money that we don‚Äôt have on stuff like massages.‚Äù Everything that he was saying was so negative. I know we have the money so I don‚Äôt mind spending $60-$100. He doesn‚Äôt look at it that way tho. He‚Äôs a penny pincher and is super cheap when it comes to spending money on certain things. I look at it like, it‚Äôs just money and it can be replaced and I like to live in the moment. Where as he looks at it like he needs to save every penny because using it on things to do now, can be done later. I just feel like I can‚Äôt take it anymore. It‚Äôs been 7 years of this.  There‚Äôs no fun in our relationship and it‚Äôs starting to take a toll. I‚Äôm just bored with him.

I said that there was nothing to love about heart attacks and diabetic comas. At that point Rachel said \"ENOUGH!

Someone suggested arranging some stuff for James on the trip so it still feels special for him, which I think is a good idea. Also, not that it matters too much but I‚Äôm a man! I‚Äôm getting called a mother a lot.\n",

      "My wife and I are both 51 years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to her getting sick, we had a great marriage. My wife was the best cook and always had our lives organized and running without a hitch without ever coming off like she was micromanaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also both were high achieving professionals. She was an editor at a New York magazine. I am an environmental consultant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in late 2022 she was diagnosed with Stage 3 esophageal cancer. She had to have surgery and could no longer work. She changed greatly. Before she was a confident, fun person. After that, it was like she saw the entire world to be something she needed to protect herself from. \n",
      "\n",
      "Frustrations that she usually would take with a smile on her face, like me forgetting to go the grocery store or ( because I travel for work) missing the last train from DC back to New York and needing to delay my arrival by another day now became things that would make her upset. There's nothing more frustrating than running into traffic, missing your train, and then dealing with her crying about being alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife usually has a caregiver, but not 24/7. The hardest part of her cancer is that besides the physical toll, there are a lot of unpleasant smells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Namely feces and urine. She suffers from incontinence. But from what I understand, it isn't 100 percent she can't control those functions. She uses adult diapers, but even those don't fully mask the smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been away for both work and vacationing with friends for the last 2 months. But our last fight started because my wife had changed out of her diaper and said she should be fine for a few minutes. The diapers were in our bathroom and I asked her several times whether she was fine. So I went to the bathroom and when I came out I get assaulted by the strong stench and sight of feces on the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said I asked her so many times, and was frustrated. She yelled she couldn't help it and asked me to help clean it up. We left on very bad terms. I was in London for work and she was terse with me when I offered to send her a gift from there. Then she was angry that I was going to Rome, Greece and Morocco with a group of guy friends. Now I have been going up to the Hamptons with long time friends. They ask me what's up and I finally just start venting about the fact that it was so hard to deal with someone I am supposed to want to sleep with being incontinent. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was alcohol involved, so I feel like I may have told the story of seeing the puddle of brown up close too many times. Now it got back to my wife because my friend's fiancee (29F) made a Johnny to her Amber joke about my wife online with a recording of me talking about the incident. \n",
      "\n",
      "I apologized and said I was venting and was suffering from carrying the entire burden of our family. Now my kids found out too and are ostracizing me too. AITA? I told people this in confidence and I didn't realize somebody would post it online. It's since been taken down but the damage is there.\n",

      "\n",
      "He had severance for 10 months at half his salary. During that time we both searched for jobs, but the Boston- Rhode Island job market is shameful. Everybody seems to have an MBA/ PhD in Boston. Meanwhile I have a GED while my husband has an associate's.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both tried for so long and I only got an offer for a job that paid minimum wage and was located in a sketchy part of town. I gave up and fell into a depression. My husband insisted that the East Coast is overrated and other job markets were less competitive so he was going to look there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he found a contract to hire job in Minnesota. Obviously a cheap place and the fact he had a job pulled me out of zombie mode. However, all of our friends are on the East Coast. But most importantly, my daughter, now 12 is a ballet dancer and is very serious about it. Name an intensive or a competition and she's probably participated in it, and likely placed, often at least 3rd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ballet scene is on the East Coast. The best studios are there as well. My daughter's dream is to dance for New York City Ballet. I drive her an hour one way to study at a prestigious studio in Boston. Her instructor there is the best of the best. I just could not justify moving to the middle of nowhere essentially when my husband was just doing a six month contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the six months my husband rented there while we stayed in RI. Then he was hired full time 2.5 months ago and we have begun arguing because he said summer was the best time for a move. I told him to take the job but keep looking for jobs back home. He said this company took him on when he was in need, that rent in MN was 1/3 of what it is in RI and the pay is only slightly less in his industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was this back and forth and then last weekend I took my daughter to a dance thing in New York, we missed our train back, and I decided to book a night at a hotel rather than scramble to get back.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband freaked out because the school called since the cell signal was bad so I couldn't call the school about an absence. He was also mad about the hotel bill and accused me of using him as a remote ATM and demanded we make arrangements to move because this was a perfect example of how he felt that he was parenting with a blindfold.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him to calm down and that he didn't see it from anybody else's perspective. We'd be moving to a place where I know nobody. My husband doesn't understand how isolating that would be. I try to FaceTime him whenever possible but my husband admits that he wants me here in part because he wants to have sex. We are in a bad situation now, but I feel like I'd be a bad mom for uprooting my daughter from dance because of essentially sex and parenting insecurities on my husband's end. AITA?\n",

I proposed that this will be done in a week. I agree that this request is reasonable. The part where I had problem with is execution.

      "* I met my wife in mid-2017, via Tinder. We went on dates for like a month then started relationship as a couple.\n",
      "* My wife (still gf back then) first found out about there is something unusual between me and T in late 2019, when we went on a day trip with my old company. My wife asked me about T and told me that \"I didn't know you have a very close friend at work, you told me you are not close to anyone at work\". I denied that and told her there was not much of anything.\n",
      "* Later in April 2020, my wife had access to my phone and were able to read the chat between me and T. My wife was furious and told me that she'd not gonna marry me if this thing with T doesn't end. She's not gonna marry me+T as a package. I agreed to end the thing with T, wrote to my wife a long letter saying how sorry I was and that continuing with T is risky. My wife said, she was deeply touched. Looking back, all the things I said back then was true. I practiced keeping distance with T for a while, until there was a company trip of that year, where I and T became close again. This time it is entirely my fault. After this, T and I are close and we sometimes met outside of work at cafes or having lunches.\n",
      "* I left my old job on March this year. At that time, I thought to myself that the thing with T is now over, we are no longer coworkers so there are not much to talk about anymore. I order flower with a note saying \"Goodbye\" to her. It was red roses, which I chose mostly because that particular bouquet was on sale and cheapest available. My wife then found out that I gave flower to T and was livid. I apologized to my wife and told her that things between me and T are over. This time I didn't think too much about what I said, just wanted my wife to cool off. After this time, I let the feeling of lost of something I used to have closeby (a work buddy) took over and eventually, it turned into a new crush. I continue texting T and asked her to meet me at cafes sometimes. This is when I asked her to have an affair with me or to tell her mundane things over my life, even things like that my wife likes to watch make-up tutorial videos and spend hours testing a new look, while I told T that in my memory, she look effortlessly gorgeous.\n",
      "* The last straw was T's birthday, when I ordered a cake delivered to her. My wife sensed that something is not right and check my phone when I was sleeping. She found out about the cake, about that nothing between me and T has actually ended and that I was lying to my wife for such a long time. My wife woke me up at 3am and asked me about T. The first thing I responded was \"did you just check my phone while I was sleeping?\" I yelled at my wife the next morning over how she didn't respect my bare minimum privacy. \n",
      "* After the affair was exposed, my wife texted T for the first time. T called my wife back, and my wife realized T isn‚Äôt a decent person. T denied that she had anything to do with this, even that she flirted with me. T told my wife that she would continue to contact me as we have colleague relationship.\n",
      "* After this call, my wife received a text from an unknown number saying things like \"let me eat your p\\*\\*\\*\\* and I'll give you money\". My wife told me that but I didn't took any action right away. My wife doubted that it was T or her cohort doings, because it was an isolated incident and none other followed (not right if her number was leaked to escort/pros. finding websites). I then texted back to T saying that if that attack on my wife as anything to do with T, it must stop.\n",
      "* My wife and I then went to my parents to talk. My parents, as all Asian parents, said that we should be calm and look for a solution. \"Leaving is easy, staying is more difficult\". What worked up my wife was that, my parents talked about the situation as something usual and my wife should \"relax\" and not take everything too seriously, as men will always be men.\n",
      "* On the low libido thing, I got it checked and confirmed that my T-hormone level was much lower than normal. My wife was kind enough to join me to see the doctor.

      "My wife and I are having a disagreement over a remark our son (17m) made. He and a friend were on the back patio and as my wife cracked the door open to let a breeze into the house, she overheard him say something about ‚Äútelling Mr. T (his math teacher) I couldn‚Äôt do the homework because I was too busy pounding pussy‚Äù. \n",
      "\n",
      "She was really upset by his use of the phrase ‚Äúpounding pussy‚Äù, which she feels is objectifying/demeaning towards women, and wants to punish him by grounding him for a few days. I told her that I appreciate her making sure that our son doesn‚Äôt become an Andrew Tate and that I‚Äôm more than happy to talk to him about how it‚Äôs wrong to objectify women in general, but that I don‚Äôt think the phrase itself is necessarily objectifying and so we shouldn‚Äôt automatically ground him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is my reasoning: I can see how it would be objectifying if he was using the word ‚Äúpussy‚Äù to refer to women in general (like calling a woman a ‚Äúpiece of ass‚Äù), but it sounds like he meant it anatomically, which is crass but not sexist. For instance, if my wife overheard our daughter (21f) make the same comment, but instead about ‚Äúsucking dick‚Äù, this wouldn‚Äôt be a cause for concern. (Obviously it‚Äôs a little uncomfortable to hear your kids joking about sex, but we‚Äôve done our best to raise them to not have any shame or stigma around sex.)\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife insists that it‚Äôs different when jokes like that are made by men, so I came up with a script along the lines of ‚Äúyour mom heard you make x remark, and I just wanted to make sure you weren‚Äôt using that term in a demeaning way.‚Äù But my wife would like me to take a harder line by grounding him and telling him he needs to apologize to her. \n",

      "Edit: to answer some common questions in the comments. Yes, he is sexually active and I‚Äôve spoken to him about using protection. No, he didn‚Äôt actually say anything like that to his math teacher - my wife thinks he was joking about a ‚Äúwhat if I said x‚Äù scenario. And as far as we know he hasn‚Äôt actually been neglecting his homework - he‚Äôs on an advanced math track (taking Calculus 3) and has an A average.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit 2: Based on the responses here, it sounds like the consensus is that I was wrong and what he said was sexist. I still don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs sexist (and I would be really grateful if someone could explain it to me), but I‚Äôll sit him down and let him know that what he said was objectifying and unacceptable. I still think that it would be an overreaction to ground him, even for a weekend like my wife wants to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: I picked my son up from school today and talked to him about how what he said is demeaning towards women because it reduces women to their body parts, has a violent connotation, removes women‚Äôs agency, and encourages men to rape women. He did ask ‚Äúwhat if a lesbian woman said that about using a strap-on on her girlfriend‚Äù (which I kind of expected, since he is autistic like me and we have similar ways of asking questions), but I shut him down by telling him it‚Äôs just different when it‚Äôs a man talking about a woman and that questioning it proves the point that he was being sexist. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we got home, I took the advice of the top comment here and told him if it‚Äôs just a phrase then why doesn‚Äôt he repeat his remark in front of his mom. Unfortunately he took it literally and did exactly that without an ounce of shame, which upset her greatly. I then made him apologize to her, and he did a pretty good job - roughly he said ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt understand why I said was sexist, but I will trust your experience as a woman when you say it is. I‚Äôm sorry for demeaning women with my words and I won‚Äôt use that language in the future.‚Äù He‚Äôs a little upset because we told him he‚Äôs grounded until Thursday (which means he has to reschedule a date he had), but I‚Äôm thankful to the users here for the good advice.\n",

My partner and I rarely have arguments and this issue isn‚Äôt a really big one, but it is something that we‚Äôve had a bit of a disagreement on and I‚Äôve found myself being more emotionally affected by our disagreement than I initially thought. I ended up tearing up which honestly surprised the sh* out of me. I mainly just want to know what everyone‚Äôs take is on the situation because not only do I think it‚Äôs an interesting topic but also just to possibly gain new perspective on the situation. So first things first, I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm entitled to anything ESPECIALLY if that thing involves anyone‚Äôs autonomy. That being said, I feel guilty and ashamed for wanting things like that. I rarely feel this way but I feel really bad about it on this occasion. \n",
      "\n",
      "So some context. I, (21) and my partner (22) have been together for about 3-4 years. We‚Äôve been living together for around 3 years. When I was 18, I moved out of my parents house and into my partner and their mom‚Äôs house. I basically moved out during the height of the pandemic. Back then I had a horrible relationship with my family. Once I got out things got better but also harder- my childhood basically didn‚Äôt teach me very much of anything so once I moved out I had to pretty much try and teach myself a lot of things I wasn‚Äôt used to (ex: eating healthily, self grooming, etc) I was also finally able to access mental health care and start treatment. Anyways, even though my relationship was pretty bad with my family I was still open and willing to keep contact and try and actually cultivate a real relationship with them. I was one of the luckier ones, my parents actually tried and put in the effort to maintain a relationship with me and now it‚Äôs pretty good. So for around 2 years I lived with my partner and their mother. Recently my partner and I moved out of their parent‚Äôs place and to my home county for their job. So now we‚Äôre significantly closer to my family than we used to be. Because of this, I‚Äôve wanted to bring my partner along and attend my extended family gatherings. When I was still living with my immediate family all interactions with my extended family felt stifled, I couldn‚Äôt really interact and build a good relationship with my various aunts and uncles because I always felt under threat by my parents. So I‚Äôm really looking forward to finally be able to see my extended family and introducing my significant other to them- if anything I‚Äôm also really excited to finally get to be myself around them and hopefully cultivate a good relationship with them as well. My partner‚Äôs been able to meet my mom‚Äôs side on various occasions but never my dad‚Äôs. During this time of year, my immediate family typically celebrates the various holidays (Thanksgiving - New Years) with my dad‚Äôs side of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      " My partner‚Äôs family on the other hand, is very small. They don‚Äôt really celebrate holidays at all or make a big fuss about it. They‚Äôre a single child with divorced parents and neither of their parents really get into the festivities. So their whole life they‚Äôve never really celebrated the holidays in the way a lot of people do. Which, don‚Äôt get me wrong I could honestly give less of a sh*t about the holidays as well lol. So finally spending the holidays without all the fuss for the past couple years has been great breather for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we live closer and the pandemic uh.. has kind of calmed down for a lack of better words.. I want to be able to spend a bit of the holidays with my family. My partner works on holidays and has the graveyard shift so celebrating with my dad‚Äôs extended family this year is sadly out of the question (their work schedule is Tue-Sat). That means the only time that me and my partner can spend some time with my immediate family for the holidays is on Sunday. Which conveniently, both Xmas and New Years fall on a Sunday. My family is religious and my partner is an atheist. I myself, am agnostic/aesthetic. Growing up I‚Äôd dread having to go church for Christmas but for the most part I didn‚Äôt mind too much. In fact I‚Äôd be lying if I said a part of me didn‚Äôt miss small traditions like that with my family. Since I‚Äôm not able to celebrate the holidays with my family (they usually celebrate one the eve of both Xmas and New Years) I wouldn‚Äôt mind going to church to spend time with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I realize that most people at this point would probably say ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you drive yourself/spend time with your family without your partner?‚Äù Well unfortunately that‚Äôs not possible for 2 reasons. Firstly, I can‚Äôt drive üòÖ. Secondly, even though my relationship with my family is better- I‚Äôm not at all comfortable being alone with them. If I were to be alone with them, with no immediate way out, in a CHURCH of all places? I‚Äôd have a freaking melt down. Just thinking about the idea is giving me nausea and a lump in my throat. No way in hell would I be able to keep myself together without my partner there to support me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sigh, and here is where the conflict lies. My partner both works and is earning their masters degree online. They get the next couple weeks off of school. They really really don‚Äôt want to spend half of their weekend at church with my family... which I get. I get that.. I don‚Äôt want to be around my family any longer than I have to be either- but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want to see them... I just haven‚Äôt spent the holidays with them the past few years and I hate to admit that I miss that bit of ‚Äútradition,‚Äù the feeling of holiday festivities.  On top of that, my grandmother‚Äôs brother recently died at the age of 93. His funeral was just last Thursday actually. My grandma is the eldest of 13 siblings. There are only 3 of them now, including her. She‚Äôs starting to have memory gaps and she‚Äôs turning 96 this coming month... this very well may be the last Christmas and/or New Years I‚Äôll be able to spend with her. I really don‚Äôt want to be forced to choose between Xmas and New Years.. sigh and On top of that top- my dad‚Äôs mother is flying back here from the Philippines for a short period of time. She‚Äôs also getting up there in age as she‚Äôs in her late 80‚Äôs. She‚Äôs arriving on the 30th though... AFTER Christmas... I want to be able to spend time with my family on both holidays. But my partner doesn‚Äôt want to go at all... and even if they agreed to go to one and not the other- well.. I feel like I am being really selfish which is why I feel so ashamed and guilty- but I don‚Äôt want to choose, I want to go to both. Service on both days start at 10AM and I expect that we‚Äôll have lunch with my family afterwards and then head home... so we‚Äôll really only be spending time with them for half the day or less. I feel like that‚Äôs not asking too much...\n",
      "\n",
      "But another part of me understands that at the end of the day I can‚Äôt force my partner to do something they don‚Äôt want to do. Our tolerance for social events are different and I don‚Äôt want to make them do something they‚Äôd rather not do... but it‚Äôs also important for me to spend what may be my last holidays with BOTH of my grandmothers... my parents may not have treated or raised me well, and my grandmothers also had their faults but they both did more than my parents. They were actually nice to me (like 1/3 of the time), they fed me, they clothed me, they played with me, they picked me up from school.. idk like I said I feel so guilty for not wanting to settle for either Xmas or New Years. At the same time I also feel so weak and ashamed to not be able to force myself to be alone with my family. Even if it f*cks me up I‚Äôll at least be able to see them AND not force my partner to do anything they don‚Äôt want to right...? Still, I‚Äôm hesitant about that.. \n",

      "Hello. I am a part of the lgbtqia+ community and my pronouns are they/them. Also my preferred name is Redd. A couple years back I came out as genderfluid to both of my parents. They are very supportive and are willing to learn as much as possible about the queer community. My dad has my brother‚Äôs name tattooed, but not mine. He wants to get tattooed soon and asked me about design ideas, so we talked about that for a while. Then I brought up something about the name I wanted on there, I don‚Äôt exactly remember how. I said how I wanted ‚ÄúRedd‚Äù as the final name, but my dad‚Äôs expression changed. ‚ÄúIf I get your name tattooed I want it to be *insert deadname here*‚Äù. Obviously I didn‚Äôt agree, because my deadname brings up trauma and overall discomfort. I mentioned how uncomfortable I would be if he did. Side note, I don‚Äôt like arguing with people, I am usually the peace keeper in the family. Then he said ‚Äú*deadname* is the name I gave to you when you were born. You‚Äôre always gonna be my daughter‚Äù that really triggered me but I kept my calm. We ended our visit and we haven‚Äôt talked about it since, and he still hasn‚Äôt gotten the tattoo. So what do you think, AITAH?\n",

When we started talking about marriage, he asked me if I wanted kids, and he told me he wanted to be a father. He's always wanted to have kids of his own. I never wanted to have kids. Honestly, I just don't see the appeal.\n",

      "Mothers say childbirth is a miracle, but I just feel the opposite. I love my husband. I wanted to be with him forever and be his wife, so I told him I wanted kids too, despite the fact that I didn't. The first time I found out I was pregnant, I had an abortion. Me and my husband have separate bank accounts, so he didn't know I paid for it and so that way he wouldn't know about it.\n",

      "I didn't want to risk getting pregnant, so I secretly had a Tubal ligation, where I had my tubes tied. I didn't tell him this for years; he thought I was struggling to get pregnant. I faked being sad, like I wanted to get pregnant and was sad that I couldn't. He even felt bad because he thought maybe it was his fault we couldn't have kids. I told him I still wanted to have kids with him so he could feel better. I thought maybe he would get tired of it and give up, but he told me that adoption was another option if I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point, I knew he wouldn't stop, so I told him the entire truth. He's upset that I lied to him, and he told me he feels like I should have told him the truth about not wanting to have kids and having my tubes tied, but it's my body's choice, and I lied to protect his feelings. He's currently staying with a friend, but I feel like his reaction was over the top. It's none of his business if I have my tubes tied; he's mad at me, and I don't know what to do. I‚Äôm his wife he should love me and want to be with me even if I don‚Äôt want kids or don‚Äôt.\n",

      "We are the parents of 5 children, 4 girls and our youngest who is a boy age 6. Our son has been increasingly curious in my wife‚Äôs naked body. She grew up in a family where she never saw her father naked and only remembers seeing her mom naked once. This experience made nudity taboo, something she doesn‚Äôt want to pass on to our kids. I get that, and I don‚Äôt have any issues with her being naked in front of my daughters. They don‚Äôt seem to mind. My son, however, notices her nudity in a much different way. He stares at her naked body with acute focus on her breasts/genital area. It‚Äôs weird IMO. Most of the nudity occurs after a shower or while getting dressed, though there are longer periods of nudity when she is looking for bra/underwear. For the record, I avoid being naked in front of any of the children. So, AITHA for wanting my wife to cover up in front of my six year old son?\n",

      "I (34F) was watching episode 8 of the new season of Only Murders in the Building when my fiance (33M) came and sat down next to me on the couch. The actress who plays the police officer came into view and he immediately said \"Damn, that's a big bitch!\". I was in shock... He quickly noticed my shock and asked \"which part are you mad about? Me saying she's big or me calling her a bitch?\" I said \"Um..both. wtf? That was so misogynistic..\" He started saying it wasn't and how he was just quoting a movie but couldn't remember which one. (I had to use context clues from how he was describing the movie and it turned out to be Shallow Hal i guess) He said \"what's the big deal.. I'm saying it in the comfort of my own home\". I asked if he then thinks it would be okay for me to say the N word in the comfort of my own home (which for the record we are white and i would never do that) . He wouldnt answer yes or no, just went off on a tangent of how can you even compare what i said to that blah blah blah. Went on to yell at me to explain to him how what he said was misogynistic. I told him it's never okay to comment on a woman's weight or refer to her as a bitch so casually. It just bothered me. Am I reaching? He doesn't think anyone else would agree with me and thinks it's unfair to compare it to saying the N word (which I wasn't exactly doing I was just using his logic to show him how messed up that sounded)\n",

Part of this was due to her having anorexia but eventually she beat her mental illness but she went the complete opposite way and gained a ton of weight and became chubby. I brought this up to her in the subtless way possible by making healthier foods for dinner, bringing her to the gym with me and by having a talk about how being overweight is unhealthy. Thankfully this has worked and she has lost a considerable amount of weight and is now a normal size. \n",

The wedding was to be late in the day, the ceremony was to happen at sunset and there was a reception afterwards. I live only a few kilometres from the venue where the wedding was taking place. My parents asked if they could stay over on Saturday night as they live approximately a 45 minute drive from from me.

She worked until the Thursday night before my parents came to stay. She was off work on the Friday but even though she knew my parents were coming to stay she didn't tidy up or prepare.

I have discount codes for Fares, Hotel Accommodations, and transportation. I have a set date to rebook everything with the company to make sure our reservations are set in stone. I was given possible prices and round higher based on what the contracts say. As of right now we are a party of 9 and our portions per person are $305. I let everyone know and everyone was happy that it wasn‚Äôt so expensive since I wanted an out of state bachelorette party. The party last a week and my Matron of Honor(34F) has started a new job and unbeknownst to me the probationary period for this job is 12 months‚Ä¶ meaning she likely won‚Äôt make the trip. She told me this via text and I was upset. I did not want to make her feel at fault for something she couldn‚Äôt control however it is frustrating. Only because I‚Äôve never heard of that before. 90 or 120 days yeah but 12 whole months? So I was upset, I didn‚Äôt let her feel or see it though. But I would like everyone there and I asked if moving the party week to a later month would help? I figured I could move the dates to later if that was the case and it wouldn‚Äôt be much. It‚Äôs just such a bummer because I wanted everyone there and it‚Äôs unfortunate she might not be there. I wouldn‚Äôt want her to be sad about missing it because of me you know? AITA?\n",

I ended up asking her when she‚Äôs moving and if she found a place. Just chatter. Then I left the room kind of irritated and went to the kitchen. My friend was there and he asked me how it was. I angrily said: next time find me someone with smaller nose. When I turned around she was there and heard me. She just mumbled she was getting a beer and smiled and nodded before leaving. She didn‚Äôt make any eye contact with me the rest of the evening. I felt I wanted to cry because she didn‚Äôt deserve this. I really took out my frustration at her because I was angry at my friends for setting us up.

      "\n",
      "1. Unplugged ceremony and reception until dinner is over and the dance party starts. That means no phones at all unless a very huge emergency. People were ok with the ceremony part but they found the dinner part too much. Many of my parent friends also said that since they're leaving their kids at home they should be at least be granted a little grade to check their phone with their kids babysitters. I said if I made an exception for them I'd have to make it for everyone so no. Unplugged means unplugged. Checking with your kids is not an emergency. If something serious happens you'll know.\n",
      "2. Color scheme and strict dress code. All black color scheme and mandatory dresses for women and tuxedos for men. No pants allowed for women. I got reactions for this for two reasons. One reason was that my aunt who's been mourning her dead husband for over 2 years just got rid of black clothes couple of months ago and tries to move on and claims wearing black makes her depressive. Another issue was the mandatory dress as my husband's sister have body dysphoria and hates dresses on her and always wears pants. Again if we make an exception for two people we'll have to make an exception for everyone.\n",
      "3. Bridesmaids diets. We've ordered the bridesmaids dresses months in advance. So they'll stay on the weight they are right now. If you're bigger size do whatever is in your power to stay big. If you're skinny, quit fast food for few months and stay skinny. If the dresses don't fit you we're gonna have a fuckin problem so stick to your fuckin diets. They had an issue with this claiming I can't police their eating habits. One of my bridesmaids claims she developed an ED from that rule but there's no official diagnosis so idk if she's valid.\n",
      "4. My MOH's daughter is supposed to be our flower girl but MOH claims she can't do this since the kid will have to stay with a babysitter at a hotel after the ceremony. She lives 4 hours away from me and where I'll be having my wedding. She planned on letting her daughter with her mom to save money on babysitters and refuses to bring the kid as a flower girl and leave her at the hotel with a babysitter.\n",

We met and started dating in high school. A month ago, I met Alicia at a party. At first, we were just friends, but after some time of getting to know her, I started getting feelings for her.

It was pretty uncomfortable because she started crying and told me how much she loved me and wanted to marry me, etc., but I told her there was someone else, and then I left. I wanted to break up with her because I didn't want to go behind her back and sneak around, and I didn't want to cheat on her because cheating is wrong, and I didn't want to be a cheater; it wouldn't be fair to her, definitely wouldn't be fair to Alicia, and I didn't want to lie to Alicia. \n",

My mother is mad at me for bringing her, and my sister called me an asshole for bringing her. She also called me an asshole for breaking up with her and breaking her heart.

      "  is is an update to my previous post, if you don't know what's happening. My son (36m) cheated on his wife for 10 years with another woman. My son and his wife met and started dating when they were freshmen in high school. Recently, my son cheated on her and divorced her, and next week my son is marrying his mistress. and I have decided after talking to my husband that I will attend my son's wedding. I thought posting on this subreddit would help, but from all of the comments, it's clear to me that none of you have children; if you did, you wouldn't tell me to just disown my own son on the spot. What my son did was horrible, and I am incredibly disappointed in him, but this isn't abandoning my son worthy. You guys were acting like my son was a serial killer; he just had an affair, and you shouldn't disown your son because of that. I have not fully forgiven my son, but I will in time. He is my son, and I love him, and what he did wasn't unforgivable. My son and his ex-wife didn't have kids, but if my son and his new wife have kids, I want to be there and be their grandmother, but I'm sure if I don't attend this wedding, my son and my new daughter-in-law wouldn't allow me to see them. This is a complicated situation, but my son's new wife is my daughter-in-law now, and I just have to accept that it's either that or not be in my son's life, which is what the comments were saying, but if you have kids, you know it's not that easy. I don't blame any of you. It's clear you don't have kids, and if you do well, I feel pretty sorry that you would just hate them after a mistake they made.

Here's some context - I've (M24) known this girl (F24) for almost half of my life. For a majority of it we have been friends but we have always had tension and we had a little fling for like a month back in high school. We've always had love for each other and she truly is like family to me. I care for her immensely and would do anything for her. The past few months we started hanging out a lot more often and started to develop serious feelings for each other. Since we've known each other so long we know almost everything about each other including what we want in a relationship, what we want in the future as individuals and literally everything in between. It's all perfect. But my one thing and probably the only thing I feel extremely uncomfortable about is her gay bestfriend. Now before I get hate, I'm not homophobic in any way whatsoever I really don't care that he's gay. I've chilled with him and he's cool I got nothing wrong with him. But in the past they were roommates. They have had drunk nights where they kissed, they have cried together, they spend holidays with each others families and sometimes would even cuddle/sleep together. The idea of my person having shared all these experiences with another human being and then that human being becoming part of my life indefinitely, really makes me feel grossed out. I would feel disgusted at our wedding looking over and seeing this man there, knowing he has felt every intimate feeling with my future wife that I also had (aside from sex). When her and I argue, this will most likely be the person to comfort her. They tell each other everything and quite frankly I don't think I'm capable of handling that. She truly is perfect in every other way. Maybe I'm being immature but I physically get disgusted at that thought of this guy having all these experiences with her and then me having to be around him. I also do not have it in me to ever make someone destroy a friendship for a relationship. WIBTA if I am honest with her and tell her exactly why I can't go forward with this? If it was any other girl I would simply just say I'm not ready for a relationship or I'm not interested etc but we both know how we feel about each other. With her, if I were to end it with her I'd have to be honest. \n",

I know a lot of people are making the argument \"if it was a girl how would you feel?\" Honestly if my girlfriend was making out with another girl and doing all this other stuff I would still feel uncomfortable it just so happens that in this situation that it's a gay guy. Really doesn't matter if it's a gay guy a girl or a robot, I personally feel that certain experiences should be limited to your partner (at least in my relationship). I don't feel threatened or insecure it's more so just someone else having that type of access to the person I'm with. Relationships are different for everyone but that's just not something I'm personally comfortable with. I should have mentioned this earlier but they also refer to each other as wifey and in the beginning he kind of had a weird feeling towards me because he never likes when she gets in a relationship. It's fine now but it did seem a little weird to me at first. Now that I think about it she has mentioned that he acts slightly more \"masculine\" the couple times we've interacted.\n",

      "So my(28M) great grandmother was full blooded Native American from a tribe. I won‚Äôt name it because I don‚Äôt know if other members of it are on Reddit and could see this. But my grandfather was half my father(58M) 1/4 and I‚Äôm 1/8 which is enough evidence to make me a card carrying member of my tribe. My extended family my Aunt (60F) and Cousin (19M) are also members. I did a ancestry genealogy test and it showed 15% Native American accurate. Well my aunt took one too and it came back 0% Native American but like over 50% Italian something our family shouldn‚Äôt have. Well she confronts my grandmother (85F) on it and she has a breakdown and admits she had a affair with a Italian man 60 years ago who she doesn‚Äôt even remember his name but said ‚ÄúMost women back then cheated because there wasn‚Äôt DNA tests or cameras everywhere or cell phones tracking you‚Äù my aunt appearance isn‚Äôt that far off from her 1/4 Native American siblings (dark hair slightly darker skin etc) so that‚Äôs why grandmother passed her off as one of them.

My cousin begged us not to or to wait until after they finished college in 4 years because they are on a Scholarship they won based on being in the Tribe. But that money should be going to a actual tribesman we feel like. My Aunt also said her whole life has been a lie and her son shouldn‚Äôt be punished due to the sins of her mother. We aren‚Äôt talking to my grandmother anymore but she left a message on our answering machine saying if we expose the secret affair she‚Äôll purposefully overdose on her painkillers. It‚Äôs a tough decision it feels like I‚Äôm betraying family either way my tribe or my blood relatives on the other side.

I was told the doctor said the infant is likely to keep the color if they haven't changed by now, and the small chance of that happening has me questioning.

When they started dating his wife and I both went to the same high school, as well as my father who worked at the school, and she was caught making out with a boy on campus in front of the building my father was working in. Despite multiple accounts from trusted witnesses/colleagues my brother decided that it wasn't true (or that he didn't care) and kept up with the relationship. Their relationship from then on was off-an-on with stories of physical and mental ab\\*se (family members actively started avoiding staying at their house do to arguments and weird behavior) as told to the family by my brother. They moved in together eventually, got married for job benefits, and then moved out of state due to that same job. Time skip to a few months (or maybe a year? Hard to keep track as I actively kept my distance. The first time he took her back after the cheating was the burning of the bridge for me) my brother comes calling, He has files of evidence of her actively hooking up behind his back through texts between her and random men within their town. These texts showed dating app messages of her meeting up with 3-4 confirmed men for 'relations'. He's imploring me to keep quiet and that he just wants a safe space to house the evidence for when he confronts her, he even vocalized that he wanted a camera or a second person to come with for proof incase she gets crazy. I couldn't do much from several states away so I said I'd keep everything safe and quiet and I wanted updates. A day or two later he's saying they talked and all was forgiven, that she'd apologized and was so sorry...\n",

      "Skip to today- a few days after a in-state visit from brother and family, with a bright blue eyed child. I've already stated that the parents have dark eyes, with my brothers parents being dark eyed as well, and I think its entirely possible that this women would try to pass of a child that isn't my brothers just for the sake of trapping him as she's extremely crazy and possessive over him (I have many stories to prove that that isn't just an opinion of mine). There was no baby talk, and they weren't really financially ready for one either as they'd just made a big financial decision. None of the family ever remarks on the fact that we all know she's cheated on him, etc. I feel like I'm the only sane person for questioning anything, but I know for a fact my brother and her were rarely if ever intimate as he's told me himself multiple times before she ever became pregnant. I want to DNA test my niece against myself to see if she's related at all. (I'm not one of those people can see parents faces in babies but I haven't heard anyone say the baby looks like my brother for what that's worth) I know I'm completely biased on this situation because I really don't like this women for multiple other reasons besides the cheating, but I seriously think that if there's any chance at all of the baby not being my brothers I should find out. My family refuses to think about how messed up the bed my brother has made is- I'd be looked at as the instigator for doing so openly but there is money, assets, a baby, and few lives tangled up in this.\n",

      "i, 13 F, have been bullied constantly throughout my life about my red hair. I have had every insult under the sun thrown at me and even have been told to unalive myself multiple times because of my red hair. the bullying got really bad around 8 years of age, i was in class and was faking my book back to the book corner when I was tripped up and was told ‚Äúyou should have never been born you ginger c\\*nt‚Äù by a boy in my class. This went on for ages, I would be shoved into the trash bin and be told ‚Äùthats where you belong you ginger peace of sh\\*t‚Äù. I told my Mother and she told my teacher everything. The next day the class were given a friendly reminder to be kind and that every one is different and beautiful no matter what. This really annoyed me but I let it go. age 11 the bullying is still happening and getting worse , there was a big group of them now and they would play games at recess called hit the ginger, the game went like this: if you hit me the most amount of times you would win. I would be hit by anything Soccer balls, sticks and punched. I told my Mother again and she phoned the school, this time I was pulled out the class and talked to, saying ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt take everything to heart. you need to learn to ignore it and it will stop. We will talk to them.‚Äù. The bullies got pulled out of class for 2 minutes each with no consequences. at this point my mental health was really bad, I would cry at the littlest things and was so insecure.  next day the played their usual game ‚Äúhit the ginger‚Äù and I ran into the bathrooms crying and I texted my mother, she said she had had enough of it and my Dad was coming to pick me up. The vice principal ( male ) came into the female bathrooms and asked me to come out, and explained he had received a phone call saying m that I had texted my mom and scolded me for having a phone in school I ran out of the building and waited for my dad to come and get me. I didn‚Äôt go to school for months and all of my friends told me that I was lucky I get to stay off, or that I‚Äôm overreacting. I managed to go into school on the last week and what I heard outraged me. I heard my bully getting detention and shouted at for calling someone ‚Äùan Indian c\\*nt‚Äú. I was so fed up and just ignored it. During Summer vacation I went to meet up with my friends and was confronted by a big gang of boys, some of them were my bullies. They all took turns telling me how ugly I was and that I should k\\*ll myself because I‚Äôm ginger. My friends laughed and I ran home my Mom and Dad were fed up with it. This kept happening more and more. The bullying has stopped with those certain boys and now theres new boys bullying me. I am very insecure about the way I look no and no teacher will do anything about the bullying. I get punched in my PSE class often and my teacher delib sat me next to the bully. I feel all of this would be handled differently if it was about the colour of my skin rather than the colour of my hair. PS. I really don‚Äôt want offend anyone of colour just sharing my story and opinions. ( EDIT ) reading all of your comments  have noticed that a lot of you feel like I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs racist towards me. I am totally not, I am saying i Feel that it should be treated similarly to if someone was getting these exact same comments about the colour of their skin. ( EDIT ) I am not trying to belittle anyone who has received racist abuse. I know i will not be denied a job because of my red hair or not be allowed it a shop. I just feel that my situation should have been dealt with more seriously. I have been doing my research and I am working on spreading awareness on discrimination towards red hair and I look out for anyone I know who have red hair. Please make sure if you ever witness discrimination in general report it. Discrimination towards red hair is the last socially acceptable form of discrimination + thank you everyone for educating me on racism and discrimination and the difference between the two.

Few years later I married my now husband Jack (55m). He was a single dad of 2 kids, Jason (25m) and Sophie (27f). Jack and I also have a daughter, Bella(17f). This is about Sophie and Ella. I always thought since they were closer to the age they would get along really well. And I was right. They were like best friends and we were really happy in our blended family. When Ella was in college, she met this guy bryan (30m) at a cafe where she worked. They started dating. I was happy for Ella. Bryan proposed to Ella in front of our whole family and it was very romantic. Everything was fine until oneday Ella came to our house screaming at Sophie. She claims that sophie has been sleeping with Bryan. I told her she must be joking. Sophie would never do that to her. There was a lot of screaming until Sophie finally said that she and Bryan are in love. This caused more commotion. We did have an extremely hard conversation with Sophie.

How can she forget her whole family here. So, I called her from Bella phone and wanted an explanation. She replied that since I never bothered to be at her wedding, I don‚Äôt deserve to be in her kid's life. She said it is not just her wedding. She claims I have never been supportive of her. That I do no care about her. She went on to blabbing that she never felt like she had my support. Even when she got cheated on and I choose my stepdaughter over her. I told her it was not fair for her to hold that against me till now because it was 6 years ago. She has moved on and Sophie has moved on as well.

I compromised and said ok, she can have a slice but then I will order a second entre for myself off the menu. She tried denying me a second entre, because her father is picking up the tab, and told me I don't need that much food.

I clean every nook and cranny. \n",

I had made this delicious meal and my sister ate it, but my BIL had a problem he complained about everything that he didn't like about it and told my sister to make him some more food.

I ran upstairs to the room I was staying in. The room I was in was right next to my sisters and BIL room. The walls were thin and I could here everything. I went to bed and the next thing I heard was things being thrown around. I got up so quick and peeked into there room and he was yelling and throwing things around then all of a sudden he hits my sister and I was pissed. I walked in a punched my BIL in his eye and we started to fight. My sister was just screaming at me to stop hitting him since he ha been clearly drinking. Now our neighbors ended up hearing the commotion and called the cops. The cops ended up arresting my BIL. My sister wasn't telling the cops anything and I was just mad at my sister more than my BIL. After all that they took my BIL to jail and she ended up kicking me out of her house and she blocked me on everything and I heard from a friend she ended up bailing him out of jail. \n",

      "Hello, my girlfriend 26f and I 31m have gotten into a pretty big fight. I talked to our friend group about it and they are a bit evenly divided about the situation so they directed me here. I was supposed to do this last week but im not entirely to keen on doing this but i feel like the females of the group have a point. I was living with a friend named steve until recently until he told me that he was planning on selling his home. I scrambled to look for a place but everywhere around me is unavailable. Now my Gf Susie has a home she owns but thing is, we've only been dating for 6months now and shes not keen on shacking up. I explained why im asking her and that i can pay majority of her bills since i make 4x what she makes but she didnt budge. Im not one to push people on anything so i closed that door. I then asked my Bf Angel and she immediately agreed. She wanted me to move in with her a long time ago when she begged me to follow her and steve to Washington state. They were both in the navy and got stationed here. She lives with 2 other girls that im friends with so they had no problem with me moving in since i visited everyday. After i moved my stuff into their house i sent a text to the friend group my gf and i share my new address. Later that night my Gf asked hiw i got a place so fast and told her its my bf place. She blew up and started cussing me out and calling me a fucking idiot. Im not very confrontational so i just asked what should i have done? She screamed not move into a place with another female and then hung up. A couple hours later 2 of the women in our friend group called me and chewed me out and told me not to be surprised if i end up single. One of them then texted what happened in the group chat and then i told my side and then the guys were on my side while the ladies were calling us idiots and other tasteful names. So are we idiots or what?\n",
      "\n",
      "Btw i forgot to tell my gf like an idiot and told her after i moved in.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for everyone to see the reason i moved out like i did was because steve hired renovaters which must have been some time ago. While i did notice him moving his stuff it never crossed my mind he'd be renovating then selling the place. By the way he was talking last Tuesday ,he made it sound like they were coming the very next day to come tear the place apart. Im not even sure if renovaters would do that that quickly but to avoid a fight i just wanted to leave. Ive lived in a semi truck for years so this is new to me. Idk what people rage bait is but please believe when i say, i grew up sheltered and did really learn much about life. But if you think its fake ill take it down because my friends have seen all of your perspectives and are now going a little more easy on me. Hopefully Susie will come around and fuck that 1 guy who disrespected her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, so my friends said i wrote this like a handicapped toddler and need to make it better so im going to answer all the common questions ive seen. \n",
      "The reason i make so much money but don't have my own place is because, Angel begged me to move to Washington state since i was an otr truck driver. Her and Steve already had places so it just made sense to me to live with one of them since i was there for them and i never really needed my own place. \n",
      "Now Steve read this and just apologized because he never meant to make it seem like i had to move the day of. The renovaters were only working on the kitchen so all this stress was for nothing üòë. \n",

      "My wife (47F) and I (49M) got new jobs with less working hours. We figured we wanted more free time. So, because of this we naturally have more free time to have sex. We used to have sex once or twice a week, but now my wife is asking me almost every two days. Once I just wanted to relax in peace and silence. But my wife came and asked if we could have sex. I refused but I was annoyed because my peace my interrupted, this reflected in me being a bit harsh. She sat very, very, close to me, this would work if I was in a good mood. As I said I was mad about this interruption so I moved her away and told her that we aren't 20 year olds anymore to have sex like that, that she needs to mature.\n",

      "I(27f) told my sister(25f) to marry the man that cheated on her? \n",
      "So my sister called me the other day in tears because it's a week before her wedding, and her fiance (21m) had slept with her old bully. Now before I continue let me explain the bully situation. My sister,  we will call her Sara, was working at a local grocery store back in 2016, and had met her ex boyfriend there. Now this is where the bully, we can call her belle, comes into play. Her ex boyfriend, we can call him Steven ,broke up with Belle( they had been dating for like 2 years when this happened) because he had fell in love with my sister at first sight and wanted to get a chance with her. Belle was devastated that Steven had left her so easily just to ask Sara out.( no weird, cheating like behavior, he literally just broke up with belle the week he met my sister) Instead of being mad at Steven she swore to one day make my sister feel as miserable as she did. She started sending her threats, constantly texting her phone, constantly threatening Steven. And it got to a point where it was extremely possessive and the law had to be threatened to make her stop.( Sara and Steven broke up in July,2019 and she soon met her now fiance, Mike, later that year in December) \n",
      "Okay that's back story on Belle now back to now. One day last week my sister had to check Stevens bank statements because he was complaining about not having any money for basic things, just to see if they had been playing for subscriptions they don't use anymore, and in general just trying to figure out where cut back on spending. ( This is normal for them Steven is horrible with money and depends on her to check these things) and found that he had been spending large amounts of money to a woman on Cash app. Now this lead Sara down a rabbit hole, she started to go through everything and eventually found messages between Steven and Belle, that had revealed they had recently slept together. Now Belle at this point was married with three children, and had a completely new life. For reference her husband's name is John. Now once she found these messages things started to click on her head. Steven had been saying he was hanging out with a new friend he made at work that went by the name of John. Turns out he was seeing johns wife. Well shit hit the fan big time. My sister confronted Steven about this and he didn't deny it. He actually cried he was happy he got caught. But not in the way you may think. He admitted everything to Sara and said he didn't realize how much he loved her until he betrayed her. And the fear of losing her made him realize just how in love with Sara he really was. He begged Sara to do couples therapy and begged her to give him a chance to make things right. Well this is the point where I get the phone call with her in tears. I told her to let me speak to him before I suggested anything because I wanted to hear it for myself, and honestly there is no way I'm not going to say what I need to  him.  She is my little sister and our parents are not the greatest. My sister and I basically raised eachother because our parents were too busy cheating on each other, selling drugs, doing drugs, you get the idea. I love my sister and she means everything to me. I live four hours away from her and I still speak to her everyday. We know absolutely everything about each other and promised each other when we were kids that we will stay close forever, she's my best friend. So eventually she agrees to let me call Steven and speak to him myself. Now I'm not going to go into the details of the phone call, but it turned out to be better than I expected and he was very honest with me about a lot. He left me with the impression he really wanted to fix things. So I called my sister back and told her if she really wanted to try therapy that I would be there for her. Now here is the part where I don't know if im the asshole. Sara then proceeded to ask me if she should still get married next week. I didn't say yes or no I told her that if that's what she wanted I would be there for her on her big day and that I wouldnt turn my back on her for making that choice. Now our parents have a very different view on this. They called my sister weak, and said that I needed to be more harsh and convince her to leave him. Our mother completely made this about her. She is a very negative person. The kind of person you could put in the middle of a sunny flower field full of the most beautiful flowers in the world, and she will complain that she's allergic or too hot. She said that she feels like in a way she was cheated on to and that he hurt her beyond repair and she can't have someone that hurt her like thatarry into the family. My jaw dropped, I couldnt believe my mother had the audacity to say that. The whole time this was going on our mother refused to speak to my sister and instead had our dad relay her messages. She had abandoned my sister before she even had the chance to vent to her the whole situation. And then our mother blamed me for supporting her, saying if I had just told Sara that she was being stupid she would have called off the wedding. Telling me that online therapy isnt real and I'm being insane for thinking it would help them and telling them it was a good idea. Now I'm stuck feeling horrible because my mom thinks it's my fault, even though I'm just trying to be a good, supportive sister. I know once she makes her mind up you can't change her mind.. so even if it turns out badly I want to be there for her, not push her away. And I do feel like Steven really wants to try to fix things. But now I don't know. \n",

      "So I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for about 5 months now. He is my first boyfriend and things are going good. At the beginning of our relationship when I told him he was my first romantic experience he asked me if I ever had sex to which I replied no. Now this is where the lie comes in. In my later teen years (18-19) I was in a major depressive/manic episode & I eventually decided I was going to take my own life. I decided before going through with it I would lose my virginity as I didn‚Äôt want to go without that experience. So in a drunken stupor I hooked up with a friend of mine. I was so ashamed of myself after and I used those feelings to further destroy myself with alcohol and drugs. Literal weeks after that I was SA at a party while I was blacked out  (not penetrated) and attempted after. My attempt failed and I began therapy. Now I have only had sex that one time in my life and it is a very dark time for me to go back to and I‚Äôve kind of erased it from my memory. So when my BF asked me if I was a virgin I said yes. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to share that time if my life bc it is one of my greatest moments of shame, but I feel bad for lying. \n",

Hope suffered a devastating miscarriage last year, which left her shattered and lost. It was painful to witness her struggle - she neglected herself, barely even showering. It was a tough time for our family.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Last Night, Daniel dropped a bombshell: his wife, Angel, was three months pregnant and they were expecting a child in February. I could only imagine the joy this news would bring to Daniel and the whole family - our first grandchild! Hope must have been hit even harder by this revelation. The weight of losing her own child, coupled with the reminder that her brother and his wife were about to experience the joy she longed for, was undoubtedly overwhelming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, everything went sideways. Hope, consumed by her sorrow and desperation, took her anger out on Angel's car, smashing the windows with reckless abandon. The sound of shattering glass echoed throughout the neighborhood, and we rushed outside to find Hope in a state of destructive frenzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reacting swiftly, Angel dialed 911 and called the cops, citing the escalating situation as a legitimate safety concern. As Hope was handcuffed and loaded into the police car, she tearfully cried out, \"I wanted to have your first grandchild.\"\n",

      "This turn of events has left my family divided. Many of us believe that Angel was out of line for involving the police, while others argue that she did what any responsible person would do to ensure everyone's safety.\n",
      "\n",
      " On one hand, I understand the fear and concern Angel must have felt as Hope's actions escalated. But on the other hand, I can empathize with Hope and her immense sadness, leading her to act out in such a destructive manner.\n",

      "I (29F) have been married to my husband (32M) for 9 years. We have two beautiful twin girls together (4 years old). \n",
      "\n",
      "Backstory:\n",
      "We never really wanted kids but life had other plans, during my first pregnancy things were a bit tense. My husband urged me to get an abortion but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it and told him he could leave if he wanted. Ultimately he stayed and despite the rocky relationship we had during my pregnancy he turned out to be an amazing father.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My pregnancy was very high risk, I was hospitalized for 2 months due to my water breaking early, and I had post partum preeclampsia which made me return afterwards for another few days. Our girls were born early and spent a 2.5 months in the NICU. My husband stayed with them everyday and quickly became the stay at home dad as I also developed severe post partum depression. I reached the point of having suicidal thoughts and felt it was best he handled the babies until I recovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm not longer at that point but I still from depression and anxiety. Our daughters are on the spectrum (moderate to severe) and require PT and speech therapy 3 times a week and have some moderate milestone delays. My husband handles them and the household chores while I work roughly 45-55 hours a week. \n",
      "\n",
      "Us today:\n",
      "\n",
      "So,  I found out I‚Äôm pregnant again. Should we have been more careful? Probably. When I told my husband he instantly demanded an abortion this time around citing how it would be abusive to current kids as we don‚Äôt have the resources to raise a third. He brought up that he handles our kids practically alone and it‚Äôs been very difficult on him, which I completely understand and I‚Äôm not arguing that he does the bulk of taking care of the kids and the household chores. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told him I refused to have an abortion and he brought up that if I didn‚Äôt hav it he would divorce me as he can‚Äôt bring himself to raise a baby when he doesn‚Äôt have the time as he has to care for our girls. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told them that if he wanted to divorce me he could, but that the idea of having an abortion doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. I‚Äôm pro-choice but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my personal choice. He threw my depression in my face and told me I could never raise this baby on my own. He also brought up how he would try and take our twins with him as he‚Äôs more ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù than I am but that he wanted nothing to do with the the baby we have on the way. \n",
      "\n",
      "He keeps making excuses about how my pregnancy was difficult and if I was hospitalized again we wouldn‚Äôt be able to make our bills as I‚Äôm the sole financial provider for our family. \n",
      "\n",
      "Frankly, I‚Äôm not sure where he would expect to go without me so if feels like an empty threat. But I don‚Äôt know if I just need to eat my feelings on this? At this point he‚Äôs mad that I would rather have this baby‚Äôs and ‚Äúthrow away him and our daughters.‚Äù \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like complete shit and have no idea what to do. I wouldn‚Äôt have the heart to have the baby and put it up for adoption either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: a lot of people keep saying I don‚Äôt want this baby? But I DO want this baby. Just because they weren‚Äôt planned doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre unwanted. I also wanted the twins the moment I found out I was pregnant, which is why I told him he could leave then if it was a dealbreaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband suggested he would get a vasectomy and hasn‚Äôt made an attempt at doing it in the last 4 years. I should have had my tubes tied but he talked me out of the day of saying it was simpler to have a vasectomy. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we weren‚Äôt actively trying for kids we never necessarily said kids were a huge NO for either of us. I would rather be with our kids now than work, but he would likely make half my salary. \n",

      "My main issue is that he thinks he can TAKE our daughters away, get alimony/child support, and ignore this baby when it comes around. That‚Äôs just not going to happen.\n",

      "She was really upset I said that and said it made her feel worthless and I acting like she ruined the car. It's probably no big deal but I like to plan for the worst always. \n",
      "She was really annoyed I said all this. I told her she makes a big deal out of nothing. I heard this from a guy on social media that has a podcast.\n",

      "She feels like I make all these dumb rules and then hammer her about how wrong she is. She thinks I enjoy correcting her mistakes and always looking for her mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also lectured her on keeping a half of a tank at all times. She is ruining the car by only keeping 5 or 10 bucks in there.she just sighed and said why would you say I ruined the car by checking to see if it will start .I think it will be ok but she could have ruined the car .\n",
      "\n",
      "so i‚Äôve (22f) been seeing this guy (20m) for around 10 months now. we‚Äôre very relationshippy with each other but still not together as we‚Äôve told each other we‚Äôre happy not to be in a relationship and just take things slow/casual. apart from the fact we don‚Äôt say i love you and the fact we‚Äôre not actually together, we act as though we‚Äôre in a relationship. we do both use tinder and hinge too, but i know that he doesn‚Äôt go on dates and hasn‚Äôt fucked anyone else since we‚Äôve been seeing each other, so even though we‚Äôre not together either one of us would be upset if the other got with someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "anyway, he was away for a couple of months and i was getting pretty sexually frustrated, so i ended up having sex with this guy (23m) from a dating app. i finally got to see the guy i‚Äôm seeing the last couple of days, and it was super intense and we were all over each other. he kept telling me i‚Äôm all his and saying he‚Äôs obsessed with me and he really likes me and now i feel guilty.

I work as a bouncer at this club downtown and her mom has been beyond judgmental. I few weeks ago I proposed, although it wasn‚Äôt an extravagant gesture it just felt right. We were on a walk with her irritating dog talking about our future. I had been keeping that ring in my pocket for whenever the time felt right, then it did; I got down one one knee looked up into her sparkling eyes and asked the question. ‚ÄúWill you marry me?‚Äù Obviously she said yes. Although I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll ever regret this. Yesterday I brought up the topic of an open marriage. Cause she‚Äôs pretty and all but I don‚Äôt want to be stuck with just one girlfriend. I think I love her, but how do you know what love really is? Sometimes I feel I do, but is it just attraction? When I asked her about open marriage her expression kind of got blank for a minute but then she smiled and said ‚ÄúYeah of course we should do that!‚Äù. I asked her this at breakfast and the day went pretty normal up to dinner. Her parents had me over and we were just eating and out of the blue her mom goes ‚Äúso, an open marriage?‚Äù scowling. Her dad goes ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù glaring at me. I don‚Äôt know if she just called her parents and told them the minute I mentioned it, she agreed however. This is to dramatic for me honestly, she‚Äôs been so distant today. If it was an issue she should have said something, or AITAH?\n",

      "\n",
      "She said I am very controlling and mean and ridiculous. Her parents coddled her too much she is very entitled.She feels shouldn't have to ask me to use things in her own house. she is whiney and lazy like peg bundy.

      "I was so desperate I went to our pastor for guidance. His suggestions were for me to find Zora her own place and pay for it. I have been tempted to do that. He even said to get her to wear modest clothing but Zora could wear a potato sack and it wouldn't make a difference.\n",

      "I'm in a three party polyamourous relationship and my partners say they are ready to have a child right now. The way I found out was by them telling me one day that they were going to try for a child. I would have been extatic, but I am not for a few reasons. We're are in a lot of debt. Just on my end, I'm in about 20,000 and that's not included a recent car payment I procured. On top of that, my husband (one of my partners), wants us to pull from our retirement to create a cushion, which I don't think should be necessary right now if we do things right. My last reason is that this was something they decided without bringing it up to me. There was a conversation, about a week prior, about not getting an abortion if it did happen since my other partner wasn't on birth control anymore. They didn't tell me that she was purposely staying off her birth control and were actively trying. They tried to convince me that these concerns were minimal in the grand scheme of things because we are all moving in together and will be saving a lot of money. My partner (who is off birth control) makes about 90k a year, is about to get health insurance, and is starting to go to therapy. With the money we would take out from retirement, pluss all the money we'll save, they believe my concerns are things that can be handled. I've tried expressing to them that if an emergency happens and puts us in greater debt than we are in now, while my partner is pregnant, that it would spell trouble for us. They don't think that there is anything that could realistically happen that they can't handle. I'm hurt I wasn't included in the conversation about having a kid and I know that it's really not up to be to tell her when to have a kid, all I wanted was for them to wait a few months until we settle some debt to have a child. I'm not even opposed to having a child and want to start a family with them. This is literally my dream family dynamic. I'm also in the military and might be getting sent overseas for a year or two. They think that since I'll be gone that it makes no difference whether or not they wait a few months because they can try for a child and prepare for one at the same time. I'm worried I'm being immature, selfish, unreasonable, and/or projecting. I love them both dearly. It's not like I don't think they are dependable or wouldn't make great parents, I just worry about the future for all of us.\n",

So around day 5 of being with the family I had to babysit gilbert, this did not go very well as i expected because as soon as the family left he started screaming at me to turn on skibidi toilet for him.

      "  m a 32-year-old man, and I've been married to my wife, who's 30, for five years. Our relationship has always been strong, but lately, a rather controversial issue has emerged that's putting a significant strain on our marriage.\n",
      "  \n",
      "   wife has always had a keen interest in collecting toys, particularly action figures and dolls. I didn't mind it at first; everyone has their hobbies, and I respected hers. However, over the past year, her hobby has become all-consuming, and it's starting to have a serious impact on our relationship.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  tely, my wife has been dedicating an excessive amount of time to her toys. She rearranged our entire living room to create a dedicated display for her collection. She spends hours daily dusting them, arranging them, and talking about them with an unmatched passion. It's starting to feel like she's more interested in her toys than in me, and that's been making me feel neglected and unimportant.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  tried to have an open and honest conversation with my wife about how her toys were becoming the primary focus of her life and how it was affecting our relationship. I felt that our relationship was suffering, and I wanted her to see that. However, instead of understanding my perspective, she became defensive and confrontational.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  e argued that her hobby was a crucial part of her life, something she's passionate about, and she couldn't simply give it up. I understood her point of view and appreciated her passion, but I felt that her obsession was pushing me away. We were no longer spending quality time together as a couple. I felt that there had to be a balance.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  ter several failed attempts at communication and feeling helpless, I resorted to a controversial action: hiding a few of her toys in our garage, hoping it would make her realize how much her obsession was affecting our relationship. I want to emphasize that I didn't damage them or throw them away; I simply removed them from display. My intention was never to destroy her belongings; I only wanted her to understand the extent of the issue.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  wever, when she discovered some of her favorite pieces missing, she became absolutely furious. She searched high and low, ultimately finding them stashed away in the garage. When she confronted me, I admitted to hiding them, and she was beyond upset.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  y wife accused me of being controlling and unsupportive. She felt betrayed and misunderstood, and her reaction was intense. She's now refusing to talk to me, and she's even threatened to move her entire toy collection to a separate room in our house, further isolating herself from me.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  m left feeling like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I love my wife deeply, and I never meant to hurt her. My intention was solely to help her realize how her obsession was affecting our relationship. It's been a difficult and emotional experience for both of us.\n",
      "  \n",
      "So, here I am, wondering if I'm the A-hole for hiding her toys, or if it was a necessary wake-up call for our relationship, even if it led to such a controversial and painful fallout. I acknowledge that I may not have handled the situation in the best way, but I hope that, with time, we can find a compromise that allows her to enjoy her hobby while also nurturing our relationship.\n",

      "On Friday the 26th May I (26m) was out in a bar with my girlfriend (22f) of 1 year, celebrating her getting the keys to her new place. She had, two months before that gotten a promotion at a large media company in the UK. I was supposed to be moving in with her soon, so this was a big deal, as we‚Äôd never lived together before. We were drinking when a guy (M) walks in. He is around her age. She tells me he used to be fwb with her best friend, while her best friend had a bf, and her best friend and this guy would meet up at my gfs old place and hook-up there in secret. She says she used to be good friends with him too, and that she hasn‚Äôt seen him in years and wants to say hi. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the start, I didn‚Äôt like this. Firstly M obviously doesn‚Äôt respect relationships, and is fine with cheating. But what I really didn‚Äôt like was my gfs behaviour. She goes up and taps him and then gives him a huge hug when he turns round (fine). Then out of nowhere she squeezes his bicep saying how great he looked and how he‚Äôd ‚Äúhad a huge glow up‚Äù. Then says ‚Äúnot that you weren‚Äôt good-looking before but wow‚Äù. This bugged me a little but I kept my cool waiting to be introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "M asked her what she was doing in the area and she said she moved recently and gave her address. He then let her know he lived basically a 2 minute walk from her place. Her response is what started setting me off. She says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs dangerous‚Äù, and when he asked why she just gave him really intense eye contact and smiled seductively, to the point where he laughed and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dangerous‚Äù, and she says ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm just fun‚Äù. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is where I cut in. I said to her ‚Äúif you‚Äôre just gonna stand here chatting to him like that, I might as well go‚Äù. Not the best way to interject but I was annoyed and felt disrespected. Her response is what really threw me off. She literally said ‚Äúokay, bye then‚Äù. I was like ‚Äúwhat the f‚Äî‚Äù and she replied ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay you can go‚Äù. M started cracking up and said ‚Äúsavage‚Äù. I walked off. After around 5 minutes of smoking and calming down I began doubting myself. ‚ÄúMaybe I over-reacted‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe I misread the situation and pissed her off‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy else would she be so cold‚Äù.\n",
      "\n",
      "I head back & I definitely didn‚Äôt misread. M has one of his fingers in one of her belt loops, pulling her close, she‚Äôs got her hand round the back of his neck & they‚Äôre talking with their faces like an inch away from each other. I head over there, pull her away asking what she thinks shes doing. This causes a bit of a scene and one of his friends says to M ‚Äúyou gonna let him talk to your girl like that?‚Äù. M laughs and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting involved in her drama‚Äù. Me and her argue with me saying she‚Äôs disrespectful, and her saying she‚Äôs ‚Äújust catching up with an old friend‚Äù and to stop being a ‚Äúpsycho‚Äù. This triggers me and I shout ‚Äúpsycho!? You two are all over each-other!!‚Äù. M again starts laughing, & I turn to him and say ‚Äúwhy the f‚Äî are you laughing‚Äù. To which he replies ‚Äúbecause this is f‚Äîing embarrassing. You need to relax yourself‚Äù. I say ‚Äúwhy are you being such a prick?‚Äù. he basically tells me I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot big enough‚Äù to start with him and to ‚Äúwalk away before he hurts me‚Äù. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then 3 of his friends surround me and I start feeling like I‚Äôm gonna get jumped so I turn around to leave. As I walk away one of his mates shouts ‚Äúoi he just called you a p-ssy‚Äù at me. I turn around and M is laughing and calling his friend a dick for stirring. This causes me and that guy to argue. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the security guards goes over to M & starts talking to him. M says it‚Äôs fine and that I‚Äôm just ‚Äúin my feelings‚Äù. The security guard asks if I need to be removed, & M turns to my gf and says it‚Äôs up to her. She says I need to leave. At this point I‚Äôm begging her to leave with me, that I‚Äôm supposed to be staying at her place and I‚Äôm 30+miles from my own house with a dead phone.  She tells me she doesn‚Äôt care I can sleep in my car, that she‚Äôs staying and is not gonna let me ruin her night. The security guard puts his hand on my shoulder as if to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to leave‚Äù and I walk out rather then being dragged out. \n",

      "I pay for ¬£150 for a taxi and go home. I block my gf on everything. The next day my mum drives me to her place to pick up my car and when I get there she runs out to me sobbing saying how sorry she is and hopes I‚Äôm okay, she doesn‚Äôt know why she was being such a bitch etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward 2 weeks I‚Äôm at her place. She goes to get into the shower. I decide to check her phone. I see she gave that guy her number, and see she arranged to meet him for a ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù two days before. She sends a picture of her other friend, and says ‚Äúbring someone for my friend‚Äù, which he does. I then go into her messages with her friend from the pic, and it‚Äôs confirmed. They‚Äôre talking about how great the ‚Äúdouble date‚Äù was, and her friend says ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt f‚Äî M‚Äù which she replies ‚ÄúI definitely would of if I didn‚Äôt throw up‚Äù but how ‚Äúit‚Äôs a good thing, because she needs to ask her best friend if she can sleep with him because they made a deal not to go for each others exes‚Äù. And I knew she did meet her best friend that day before I went over. So no doubt it was to ask for permission to screw him. She is also saying how horny she was giving him a lap dance, how great a kisser he was, how ‚Äúbig he felt‚Äù. So also knew for a fact physical cheating happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sent all the proof to my phone and left while she was in the shower and got a taxi home. I felt lost and empty. I get home and she still doesn‚Äôt bother to text me. In fact that‚Äôs the last time I spoke to her. She blocked me on everything the day after. For about a month I am lost, but I refuse to reach out to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then one day I decide to message M. I ask him for details and he does tell me everything. I screenshot it and I‚Äôm just going to expose it all on my social media, but then I get a better idea. I remember her promotion and her morality clause and I also email it to her HR after I expose it. I expose it on tiktok and it gets over 100k likes. I make sure to specifically mention her place of employment and she loses her job. This in turn causes her to lose her new flat. She finally calls me from a new number screaming at me for ruining her life. It‚Äôs cathartic. I am in bliss at listening to her cry. I tell her to hang on and go to my sister to grab her phone. I record her meltdown on snap and send it to myself. A few days ago my sister caught me listening to the recording again. She asks wtf I‚Äôm watching and I tell her, and she lectures me calling me a psycho asshole. AITAH?\n",

He was very much a byproduct of California and he was a very new experience but I loved him and I moved to California so I shouldn't expect anything different.

However when me and Stan got closer I to the relationship we started getting intimate. And apparently I was the first girl he's ever dated, but apparently Stan has dated 3 men before me. Which I didn't mind, until Stan told me that he has never topped before and he's nervous about topping me as he's used to being the bottom. So our first sexual experience was a little awkward but later on Stan got the hang of it.  A year into the relationship we were good until things got awkward. When I brought Stan over to my parents house for the week, my mother walked in on him masturbating to Gay porn, and it made things very awkward for everyone.\n",

I said no im not doing that and we got in a fight and now I'm at the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo protecting myself from the hurricane while Stan is still in Southern California near the hurricane. \n",

We'd never meant to have Ethan, actually I never wanted kids at all (or at least until we were in a more stable financial position). I had been dating my wife for 2 years at that point and was blissful in the honeymoon stage. When she first told me she was pregnant I was angry and disappeared for 2 weeks. I came back after I had some time to calm down, but this action obviously damaged our relationship and shattered the trust she had for me at the time. I still regret running away all those years ago but the past is the past and I thought she was over it. \n",

From the start I had troubles connecting with Ethan. I always thought he preferred my wife over me (which is probably true). I just never felt a connection with Ethan like I thought I should have. My wife had a difficult recovery period after Ethan was born which put a lot of stress on me, since I was looking after her and Ethan at the same time. I think I resented Ethan a lot during that period and just never ended up connecting properly even after my wife recovered fully. \n",

He starts screaming whenever I'm doing something that's not involving him and he hits me with toys when he thinks I'm not paying him enough attention. If you've ever been hit with a children's toy you know those things hurt. Yesterday I was napping on the couch when Ethan came up behind me and put me in a choke hold. I don't even know where he learned how to do that, but he was giggling whilst I was fighting for my life half asleep and confused. I was completely exhausted and was furious that he woke me up at the time. At some point I ended up pushing him harder than I know I should have, he fell back and bumped his head on the edge of our coffee table and immediately started wailing. He told my wife I pushed him, she immediately blew up and started screaming at me. She said something about not being able to trust me even though this is the first time anything like this has happened.

My wife has always been a little dramatic but I think this is going overboard. I don't actually think I've done anything wrong it was an accident I just needed to stop overreacting and come home.

Naturally I was upset so I went to a bar to meet my two friends. I told them we broke up and they were shocked. I just wanted to drink my problems away but this girl who works at this copy place was there and she asked me to dance. I declined at first but I gave in. We were dancing and then we kissed and one thing led to another and the next morning I woke up with her coming out of the shower after sleeping together. My (ex) girlfriend left a message saying she was sorry about last night and wanted to come over and get back together. The random girl was still there when she arrived but thankfully didn't know she was there! I told my two friends about it and they both said not to tell her but the guy who works at the local coffee shop told her, for unknown reasons I still don't know why!

He feels like his life is complete and while he has stepped up and became the father he needed to be he feels that all his love needs to go to his daughter and shouldn‚Äôt be split between more than one kid, and while I can understand where he‚Äôs coming from because he never wanted kids in the first place I feel he‚Äôs not considering my feelings. We have discussed and already picked out names for our future kids, then he turns around and claims he doesn‚Äôt want another kid, and how I haven‚Äôt already gotten pregnant is a miracle because I can‚Äôt take birth control due to the side effects and he hates condoms so we‚Äôve been relying solely on the pull out method. What really messes with my head and emotions though is that during sex he‚Äôll talk about finishing in me, which gets my hopes up because I want so desperately to be a momma and to carry a child, then when the time comes he either pulls out or lifts me off of him. Occasionally I do cry after sex due to him getting my hopes up then basically saying it‚Äôs never gonna happen, which in turn makes him upset because he thinks I‚Äôm trying to force him to have another kid. So am I the a$$hole?\n",

He has told me he wouldn‚Äôt be upset if I do get pregnant he just doesn‚Äôt want to actively plan for a baby he just wants to ‚Äúlet it happen when it happens‚Äù which is different from how I think. I‚Äôm a planner I think moths ahead on decisions while he is very in the moment. And yes we may be what most people would consider young and our relationship moved pretty fast for most people, I moved in with him month 2 of dating and we got engaged 7 months into dating, but both of us were in very controlling relationships before we met each other and we are compatible in more ways than most people realize. And I get people saying I haven‚Äôt experienced life yet and that I‚Äôm still young but I‚Äôm not a party person I‚Äôd much rather stay home than go out and I‚Äôve been through a lot that has matured me faster than some, and I understand at times I can still be childish but I never do something that hasn‚Äôt been fully thought out before I commit myself to it.\n",

She managed to convince me that it was ok for me to become a father like every parent in existence. She said she loved me so much and that she wanted a baby identical to me in every way.

      "I was terrified the whole time, but it thankfully happened with no issues. At rewards the baby was in NICU for a while because of a problem with her breathing. I can never describe what I felt when I saw her for the first time. I‚Äôll just say that it felt overwhelming. \n",

I live in a developing country and without insurance (I work online) I was an easy target, they tried to keep her in NICU for as long as possible to rack up the bills. We were crushed when we had to go home without her. But after I found out their plan from a strong hint by a conscientious doctor, I managed to extricate her from the hospital and she was okay. She was a little rouged up and had some small abrasions in her nose because some idiot nurse but otherwise healthy. \n",

She started neglecting our older daughter‚Äôs emotional needs and also mine. \n",

Our daughter is 2 months old and she‚Äôs still coddling her this same way. Nobody else is allowed to hold the baby because she is now so used to my wife‚Äôs arms that she starts crying and throwing fits as soon as she puts her down for a second.

My breaking point was after an argument she had two days ago with her step brother, I grounded her and told her to give me her phone, to which she completely lashed out on me, decided to be immature and resort to name calling, and refused to give me her phone. I gave her two options, she either gave me her phone and she'd be grounded indefinitely, or she could go pack her stuff and move in with a relative who'd put up with her childish bullshit. My husband, step son, and daughter in law think I did the right thing but my daughter hasn't come out of her room for the past two days except to get food and I am worried about her, but I'm not sure how to approach this or whether or not I should apologize, AITAH?\n",

      "Today my sister told everyone that earlier this morning she made a reservation at a restaurant for her 32nd birthday, which is in 4 months. The reason she made the reservation so early is because it can be hard to get a table due to the popularity of that restaurant. I had heard of it before but after my sister told us she had reserved a room for dinner I looked up the restaurant's website. It is not suitable or welcoming for families. There are no highchairs or booster seats, no kids menu or kid friendly food (and all meals are adult portions only), no watching things on tablets or phones in the dining room, no \"loud\" voices, and a policy of no getting an \"extra plate\" to share your meal with someone. Only desserts are allowed to be shared. My sister is doesn't have kids so it's understandable that she wouldn't think of these things. I don't fault her for that but when I brought it up with her because me and all of our siblings have at least two kids (between the ages of 2 months and 4 years) she said I had no right to ask her to cancel the reservation and pick somewhere else. She said it is her birthday and she gets to pick where dinner is.\n",

      "Ever since my last relationship ended, it was my goal not to chase relationships, and I dreamt of being able to support myself, without a partner, live alone for a bit and just experience life without anyone else helping or supporting me. So I started saving up for an apartment. I had a bit saved up and then I started looking into careers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I met my now-husband and all of that changed for me. I stopped wanting to provide for myself, I stopped looking into careers, I became so scatterbrained. I didn't know what I wanted to do anymore. I was so lost. Like always, All of my energy went to my relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "He's a great, loving man, who wants to provide for me. I know to many it sounds like a dream, but I feel resentful of the fact that he wants to do that. I wanted to do that for myself. I also had many goals I wanted to cross off before I even wanted to consider life long commitment to someone. I wanted to reach a place where I had my own money. I know it sounds like hyper-independence but to me, it was just a personal goal of independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The funny thing is, I got married ON the exact opposite basis of this. I knew my partner wanted to provide. I thought that was what I wanted. But I kept oscillating back and forth between I want to be independent and I want support. Of course I finally chose support, and now that I've chosen it I'm sad I didn't get to accomplish my dream that I knew I had deep down, but with the voices of everyone around me saying \"hurry up and get married!!!\" my true thoughts drowned out. I couldn't hear myself. I tried to tell my husband I wasn't \"ready\" but I couldn't quite articulate or understand why I said that. But he pushed and so did my family and his family. \n",

And while it's been wonderful with him, part of me does feel like I gave up my dreams of experiencing life alone, to be with him. I'm struggling to live with that. My friends tell me I should just surrender and that feels SO hard. Part of me doesn't want to and I know this will go on until I do something about it. I feel like such an asshole. And there's been a lot of tension in the house because of this. I did try to tell my husband that I wish I could travel and that being tied down without having lived life feels like I'm trapped and I will have never discovered my own potential. I've told him all of these things and the energy just doesn't even feel the same now. Sometimes I think I just hurt him even more by being with him. \n",

      "I haven't gotten any closer to my professional or personal goals. I'm not blaming the relationship for this, I know it's on me. But I wanted time to get these things in order, and THEN see where my head would be at. \n",
      "This week, I think I finally decided what career I wanted, and that's only because I was thinking of what I would actually do if I were alone. It would motivate me to find a good job to support myself as I don't want to move back to my parents and stay there forever. But the only reason I thought of these things is because I was thinking as an individual. I don't think this way as a unit. I just rely on HIM because he is here. I lose my drive. It happens to me with every single relationship. \n",

      "Also, neither of us can fully support ourselves, before we met I was living at my parents and my husband was renting a bedroom at a house. I truly don't know if we just got married out of pure convenience of shared income or if we really truly want to be together.\n",

      "My girlfriend (45F) and I (55M) were at a somewhat fancy restaurant (in the Michelin guide or wants to be). It was not full, but the hostess seated several people at the table next to us. They were fine, but all of them were louder than us and we could hear their conversation well. My girlfriend cares a lot about what people around her might be thinking, and we are both on the quiet side, so we felt like we could hardly talk any more. I don‚Äôt remember what we did talk about, but there was some tension between us.   \n",
      "Then, I was saying something to her and the busboy interrupted me, definitely not good service. I scowled at him for a couple of seconds. It was an automatic reaction and I didn‚Äôt say anything unpleasant. My girlfriend was immediately upset at me for being rude to the busboy. She says that because she is class-ist (her word) from her upbringing, but liberal politically, she is especially offended by rudeness towards anyone in a service job. In my opinion, my rudeness was small, fleeting, and understandable, so I wish she would forgive me and let us be happy together. Neither I nor anyone else is perfect.  \n",
      "I have a lot of management experience, and the restaurant manager seemed easy to talk to, so a bit later I gave her some feedback about the seating and the service. It was in a discreet way and it seemed to me that the manager was happy to know about the opportunities for improvement. However, my girlfriend became more silent and upset. Later, she told me that while I was talking to the manager, a disturbed individual came into the front of the restaurant and was upsetting the staff, but I was preventing the manager from responding. I am sure this is true, but I never saw it happen, so again, I feel that I deserve forgiveness.   \n",

I figured my wife was pushing the door back and forth out of annoyance (as I had promised to find the WD-40 in the garage for about the past two weeks), so coming up with this conclusion I opened the fridge and grabbed some breakfast sausages. At this point the noise upstairs had stopped. But while the links were just beginning to sizzle on the pan... I heard the squeak come back louder.\n",

So I went on my way, it was a long drive. Silent, I could barely think and all I heard was numb white noise in my mind. I was able to make my way to the room where he was being kept, it was a sterile environment. He was hooked up to tubes and wires, his skin was a wrinkled white and grey. I was terrified, for a moment I was a boy again. Looking up from my knees as my parents lie on the wet cement next to me, I could hear the hum of the neon lights from the theatre where my parents were taken from me.  \n",

I slowly approached him, he didn't say a word. I don't even know if he could but he pointed to a note by his bed side. It was enclosed with my name across the sleeve. The handwriting was immaculate, it was not his own for sure. I looked over to a nearby nurse, she said that she wrote it on his behalf. It was a dying declaration, and I opened the white mailing sleeve, and pulled out the paper.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In silence I read the note, my hands shook and my rage subsided. And I was filled with sadness and pity. The note was an admission of guilt, of true sorrow. His words, I will not share in full as they are mine to know and mine alone. But his reasoning for the slaying of my parents was rage, was hate. They had money, they had wealth, they had happiness and he had none of it. And in a moment of hatred, he decided he wanted their happiness. He did not plan on taking their lives, I know that now. I can see the day clearer in my head than ever.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw his eyes, and they were the same dull blue. Full of shame and regret as he ran off into the darkness leaving me alone, so very alone. Tears were shed, and in that moment I understood. I understood his weakness and I understood his pain, a weakness and pain I've done my best to ensure would never befall anyone in my city.

One time I seen this was a post about a woman wanting her friend to pay for the damages in her house because her sons pulled a prank. Fine Mom and both sons are assholes. But OP clearly said the oldest, who was 18 never carried out any pranks himself up until that point. All he did was come up with them. But I see people saying that this man entered the bathroom. Why, did OP say he did? No, did the victim of the pranks say he did? No, the only one caught was the 13 yo and that is because he is the only one who entered. Don‚Äôt add to the posts with words the OP did not say. That is wrong and that makes YTA. \n",
      "\n",
      "My second issue with this group, is the blatant sexism I witness. I will see 2 posts, both basically the same with the difference being OP being male or female. I will see the man get ruthlessly dragged into the mud for doing the same exact thing a woman has done. My point, there was a post maybe a week ago about a woman wanting her boyfriend to stay home with the children full time if they had any. She then proceeded to tell him it was because she made more than him, among other reasons mind you but let‚Äôs stay on track. But a man would‚Äôve been instantly vilified for say those things. She then proceeded to tell her partner that was only way she would do it or she wouldn‚Äôt have kids with him. If he didn‚Äôt like those options he could leave. Yet some people think that isn‚Äôt an ultimatum. The only thing they had previously spoken about was they wanted someone that was a parent with them until they get old enough for childcare. She didn‚Äôt ask him how he would like the raise the children that are EQUALLY AS MUCH AS HIS, she didn‚Äôt talk about any other options, until 12 hours after the post went up. She even stated that one of the reasons her bf was mad at her was because he felt like she didn‚Äôt respect how he felt because she decided all on her own how the children would be raised like he isn‚Äôt their father. There is another part of the post that I will address in my last point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, my last real issues are the fact a lot of you can‚Äôt judge something correctly. The second issue I had with the story above was that once it was realized that the OP was the asshole because she DIDNT RESPECT HER PARTNER enough to even have a simple conversation about it all she did was demand what she wanted. They all proceeded to say that she still isn‚Äôt wrong because she is the one carrying them. Like that gives her some kind of higher authority to the child. And it is wrong. They acted like her having the kids was her compromise when all she stated in the post that she didn‚Äôt want to be a stay at home mom because she saw her friends do it and she didn‚Äôt like it. A lot of us, ME INCLUDED have an issue with judging people differently based on their gender in certain topics, rather than arguing if the actions themselves are the actions of an asshole. \n",

      "To clarify: There's a series of ragebait topics that keep being brought up to foster animosity towards certain groups. Examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The most basic: switching the expected gender in stories as a \"gotcha.\"\n",
      "* The \"black people are the real racists\" ones.\n",
      "* The \"my close family member is gay and I'm totally not homophobic but OMG they kicked everyone out from their wedding and had an orgy right on the dance floor / humiliated me, the poor straight loving family member.\" Bonus points if there are drag queens or children involved (cue the \"that is sooooo inappropriate if there were children there\" responses).\n",
      "* My favorite, because it's the ragebait topic du jour: \"I love and respect trans people and only think they should be partially excised from society, but this evil trans person lost their shit at me because I wouldn't sleep with them\" (cue the people in the comments getting livid at and bullying any cis person who says they would sleep with a trans person, the people who just have to let you know that they find trans people disgusting, and the \"did you know there are roving bands of predatory trans women forcing cis lesbians to sleep with them? - What!!! OMG, I can't believe that\"! comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the worst part is that 99% of the stories are clearly ridiculous and invented out of whole cloth, yet it's like some people can't help but lap them up and ask for seconds.

He had submitted some drawings of buildings and landscapes, but they were very mediocre and lacked any artistic flair or expression.

I was having a discussion with my fianc√© (27F) about possible food options (catering or cooking, what types of food, buffet style or served, etc.) and my mother (60F) and one of my aunts (56F) were visiting. They threw in some thoughts and advice, as they‚Äôve had weddings, which I really appreciate. The topic of drinking came up, and my aunt asked what kind of cocktails we‚Äôd be serving. I told her we wouldn‚Äôt be serving alcohol at the wedding. She was shocked and asked what everyone was going to drink. I told her there would be water, sweet tea, lemonade, punch, and soda available.\n",
      "\n",
      "My aunt said that having soda was a bad idea because it‚Äôs so unhealthy, and so is sweet tea and overly sugary lemonade and punch. I told her if was so concerned about sugar content she could stick with water, and we‚Äôre planning on having plenty of fresh fruit she could add to it. We‚Äôd also have unsweet tea for my diabetic family members, or they‚Äôre welcome to request or bring a desirable alternative. She asked why alcohol couldn‚Äôt be a request. I told her I simply didn‚Äôt wNt to serve any at my wedding. My fianc√© and I would be financially responsible for the purchase (and alcohol would frankly be out of our budget) and we would feel responsible if someone left our venue and drove home drunk. She asked if she and the other drinkers of the family could bring their own beer and said it really wouldn‚Äôt be a party without one. I said no, again, because it‚Äôs my wedding and fianc√© and I would feel responsible if someone drove drunk and got hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it was already a shame I wasn‚Äôt getting married in a church and the least I could do was make up for it with a good reception. I told her if she can‚Äôt go one evening without drinking then maybe she‚Äôs the one with a problem. At this point my mom jumped in and told me I need to apologize, I said no, I don‚Äôt appreciate how my aunt has spoken to me and she needs to leave. They ended up going, but then my aunt complained the next day on Facebook about my ‚Äúdry wedding‚Äù and said she wasn‚Äôt going to torture herself driving an hour and a half to my venue just to have a bad time. She also explained how the conversation went the day before and said I called her a drunk for being healthy. I‚Äôve been getting a lot of messages, some supportive, some on the fence, and some very angry that I want to ‚Äúruin a good reception by acting like it‚Äôs the prohibition era‚Äù. I‚Äôm honestly confused here, am I the asshole?\n",

      "I know the title sounds bad, but let me explain. So I(14 genderfluid) had a horrible grandmother(83F), who was never there for me. She always liked my cousins more, because they are men. For context as to why this is relevant, I am AFAB and my grandma had two daughters(my mother and my aunt). My aunt(51F) has always been one of the closest relatives to me, even closer than my parents, due to the fact they only care for my academic success and not my mental and physical health. My mother(46F) was never close to my grandmother, as she was always neglected as a child and only had my grandfather(deceased). My aunt on the other hand, has a seriously strong bond with her mother. She was the favorite child, that's for sure, and even she admits that. I tried my best to keep it together and show a happy face towards my grandma until 2 years ago, only a few weeks after my grandfather's death, she gave away the toy piano my grandpa gave me to this one 3 years old relative, who to this day can't speak, eat or drink properly. I was furious. This may not seem like a big deal, but to me it was, as that small little toy piano was the last thing I had from my grandfather who always treated me with nothing but kindness and love. \n",

This incident was probably the one that made my dislike for her strong enough to do what I did. As soon as we(my mother and I) arrived, it was obvious I was not really welcome there. I kept quiet and read something whilst the others were chatting away, until my aunt came up to me to ask if I was okay, since I was visibly upset. I told her I didn't feel welcomed and wanted to go home. She promised as soon as I finished my plate she'd take me home. And she did. But before I got in her car, my grandmother yelled after me, calling me a useless child and telling me she never wants to see me again.\n",

      "About 3 months ago, she(my grandma) got really sick and got into the hospital. She begged my aunt to take me to her, but I refused. After all she did to me? Hell no. I told my aunt this, who repeatedly tried to convince me to do otherwise, but it didn't work. I love my aunt a lot, but not enough for this. About 2 weeks after that my grandma finally passed away. I called my best friend(19F) right after the news and she came over to celebrate with me. This may sound like an asshole move, but I honestly didn't give two shits.\n",

My aunt came to convince me to come in person, but I explained to her I was not going, as I would not be able to stand the amount of respect this scum of earth would be getting from every relative. She was visibly upset by this, but respected my decision and left soon after. My mother got really mad at me for refusin to attend and called me a \"selfish bitch who has no respect for his ancestors and needs to get a grip\". She and my father(53M) left for the funeral shortly after and in a sudden rage, I called my best friend. I told her to pick me upp with her car.\n",

In the middle of the funeral speech, I started blasting the song starting from \"Ding dong the witch is dead, the wicked witch is deaaaaad\". An angry looking aunt stormed outside of the cemetary and just caught a glimpse of my red hair, which was enough for her to identify me. We sped off, and thought nothing would come of this little \"prank\".\n",

      "\n",
      "I 15F decided around December 2021, I'll be living a healthier lifestyle and start going to the gym. To which a few months later, I was fitter than I was before. I have a cousin, 17F, who is obese. She was already born with fat on her, but over the years it gradually built up. She knew I go to the gym but didn't comment on anything until a few months later. Whenever I was around her, usually at family events. She'd say something like, \"try a burger,\" or shit like that. Shaming for having a skinny body, and my lifestyle decisions. \n",
      "\n",
      "The whole event happened at my aunt's birthday party, which happened to be her mom. I was sitting down in the living room, eating carrots. When my cousins (Her and her little sister, 15F) and their friends came up to me. My cousin made a comment along the lines of, \"Carrots? Any more you'll be looking like that girl from Squidgame.\" (They're talking about Hoyeon Jung, who is a skinny person, to what I've seen online, also gets body shamed.) They started giggling, some smiling. It honestly annoyed me and was seriously my breaking point. Any chances they have, they'll make a stupid remark. So I replied with something along the lines of, \" At least I don‚Äôt eat the whole goddamn menu, geez, leave some for the guest, will you. Woah, you guys hear that? The floor is shaking, probably from the hippopotamuses that are standing in front of me. Careful you‚Äôll break the floors, actually I‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt yet considering all the shaking you guys are causing.\" I was happy so I smiled, almost laughed because suddenly the motherfuckers were quiet. However, her mother heard me, who happens to be also obese. She walked over to us, to yell at me for insulting her daughters and friends in front of her, and in her own house. As if they weren't just insulting me, and she didn't do shit. Which pissed me off even more, so I make a remark. \"Chill, quit stomping, you'll break the floors you pig.\" Some of the guests were looking at us, and some are doing their own things. At this point, she and her daughters started yelling at me but honestly, I didn't listen. I'm guessing one of the other guests told my parents and they quickly went inside. My aunt started berating my mother for raising such a disrespectful daughter, the irony. I couldn't stop myself, so I created another comment, something like, \"OMG, it's getting so crowded the fuck, quit taking all the space will yah?\" We got kicked out after. My parents were mad at first, not because I insulted my cousins, but because I caused a scene in front of people. Besides, my dad doesn't like them either, we're only keeping in contact because she's my mom's cousin. Also, my mom does not like conflict, and that's why most of the time I ignored it. Nor do I like confronting people. You see, in their eyes, there is no such thing as body shaming skinny people because they are society's standard. Therefore it's okay, in their minds to shame them. Also, my aunt does not like to discipline them in any way, she enables their actions to the point at their grown-ass age, they whine and make a scene like kids when they don't get things their way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, this might be the final update. I have a life to get to. LOL. I don't regret my actions, I'm going to treat you the same you treat me. And to the people wondering, I only posted this to get people's opinions if body shaming can go both ways. Also, it's honestly sad, at their grown age, they're shaming a 15-year-old. LOL.\n",

Careful you‚Äôll break the floors, actually i‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt yet considering all the shaking thats happening.‚Äù (not exact wording) I smiled, almost giggled at their faces that looked dumbfounded and angry. They were very quiet, and also her mom, heard me say it. Also obese. She got mad me, saying things like how dare I insult her daughters in her own house. I made remark, ‚ÄúYO CHILL! Quit stomping on the floors, you‚Äôll break them you pig.‚Äù Not my best moments, I was just pissed off. Everybody was also looking at us. My parents were in the backyard but came to us quickly after someone told them what happened. Everyone came inside also. VERY CROWDED. People were asking us what was going on, while the obese people were yelling at me. I made another remark, ‚ÄúOMG PLEASE ITS SO CROWDED IN HERE, QUIT TAKING ALL THE SPACE WILL YAH?‚Äù My family and I got kicked out LOL. At first my parents were mad, until I told them the story, found out my dad didn‚Äôt like them ether. Mom told me to be nicer because my aunt is her cousin. LOL.

I said that her story means 1, that Ava‚Äôs more likely to cheat and 2, that wouldn‚Äôt happen because I wouldn‚Äôt take Ava back if she did cheat on me with a stripper.\n",

      "I know the title sounds weird, but I promise this isn't a shitpost, metaphor, or a joke. I (20M) was raised by a single dad, never knew my mom who left me as a baby, and growing up I didn't really have many female (or male, tbh) friends. The reason I say this is that I don't know all that much about female anatomy; yes, I had sex ed in school, but seriously don't remember anything except \"wear a condom\", basically. \n",
      "\n",
      "I met my girlfriend \"Beth\" (21F) in college, it's my first relationship, her second. We've been together for a little more than a year now, and had sex for the first time about half a year ago. After the first couple times, Beth told me that she has a really regular and average period that she's been keeping track of with an app since she was literally 14, plus in the last few years she also started taking her temperature to get even more accurate results; I didn't understand exactly how this works, but she was so reassuring and confident I didn't question it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, now this is where I might start sounding like an idiot... So she told me her period is an extremely regular 28 days, and she has literally only strayed from this pattern once since she was 14. I also am aware that moon cycles are 28 days. (Correction here: since this incident, I Googled and it's actually about 29 days... but that's besides the point I guess.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Women tend to be associated with the moon, like Artemis; I truly, deeply believed that the moon phases and all women's menstrual cycles were inherently connected, but just like, different women had their more fertile days with full moons whereas for some it corresponds to a different moon phase, like the new moon, and this is why women differed. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the reason Beth told me about her period being super regular is that she was confident she knew when she was or was not fertile, and told me she wanted me to finish in her on safe days. We've been having sex like this for the last four months where she tells me the window of time she's safe, she's happy, I'm happy, it's working fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "I started noticing that the moon tends to be really full and bright every time we have unprotected sex, maybe not necessarily always on a \"true\" full moon, but definitely around that time. I made a mental note that my girlfriend is a \"fertile during a new moon (when you can't see the moon)\" sort of girl. If you're wondering why I never just outright asked her about this, it just seemed really obvious to me and I didn't see the point in talking to her about something potentially a little embarrassing for no reason. \n",
      "\n",
      "June 3rd was the most recent true full moon, and I decided to sort of surprise her by inviting her to my apartment and just pouncing on her wordlessly as soon as she came in. She was into it, we had sex, I finished inside her, she didn't complain or stop me at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "While cooling off, she remarked that she didn't remember telling me about her safe days in a while, so I must be tracking her period, which she actually thought was sweet lol. I said, \"well of course it's a safe day, the moon is so bright\". She asked me what I meant, and I said something like \"I know you can't possibly get pregnant during a full moon\".\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed really confused and started getting a bit tense, questioning me more, and I, also confused, started explaining to her about the moon cycle thing I fully believed up until that moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is where she freaked out completely, jumped up and asked me if I was a complete moron. She started yelling at me and freaking out about how insane and irresponsible I was for finishing in her, and how she would never have had sex with such an idiot asshole if she knew. I was truly shocked I had no idea what to say, especially because it WAS still truly a safe day, but she actually just grabbed her stuff and stormed off before I could do anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, after she left I Googled a bunch of stuff and yep, turns out I'm completely incorrect. That being said, it WAS still a safe day for Beth and she wasn't actually upset about me finishing in her or anything, just the reason I did, I guess. So, AITA?\n",

      "To clarify things for those who are calling this story fake or confused about some things. The reason i was able to get custody of our daughter but not are son is because we didn't go through the courts, given that she was a new born he agreed to let me keep her. and for people who are confused about how he works and was getting a PHD, a basic google search would help you understand that he was working in the hospital while continuing his degree. and how did I become a teacher? again use basic common sense.

I was just a college student who was eating out of a hot pot and struggling to keep up with classes. until I met Brandon I only wanted what was best for my son, a stable family. but once I met Brandon he made me see that idc about wealth I just want to feel loved and happy.\n",

And she‚Äôs doing her nightly routines like brushing her hair or putting body lotion after showering. She also used to tease and be playful, like climbing into bed from my side, naked, over me, obscuring the TV and says sorry I had to take the shortcut (instead of walking around the bed to her side). I knew she just wanted attention because she would just sit there on me. No matter what I was watching.

My friend recently got into a massive fight with her parents which resulted in her getting kicked out of the house and apparently her dad went crazy and broke things. As such she is understandably scared and needs a place to stay until she can formulate a plan. Since we have been basically best friends for so long, she turned to my family first. I said of course, she can stay for as long as she needs to after getting approval from my parents. However, when I told my girlfriend about this, she got really annoyed and asked if we had ever slept together. I said yes and explained the situation and that she (my gf) was the only one I wanted to be with romantically. She then said clearly she was hot enough for me to fuck once so nothing was stopping me from doing it again. \n",

I know that if I had a choice myself, I would never put my wife through that again. Seeing her in that much pain and panic will forever be etched in my brain. She has nightmares from the experience and cries often. I will say this though.. the overwhelming love she has for our baby is literally the most heartwarming thing I've ever witnessed. But some days are harder than others. Like the day before yesterday she had a great day but yesterday, she cried off and on for the majority of the day, over seemingly small stuff (like a buddy came over and his wife asked to hold the baby- which my wife allowed, but she cried the second she was out of sight from everyone and then isolated with the baby right after).

Like she had pizza and the baby got gassy and fussy so now I would prefer if she pumped so we could bottle feed if she wants food that could make the baby fussy. Or she said she wanted a beer yesterday and despite the doctor stating that she could drink up to 3 without it getting in the breast milk, I would still prefer she pumps. Same with soda. She wanted a soda so I asked her to pump first. But I've noticed that every time I ask her to pump, she gets pissed and walks off. Stating \"I will just go without, thanks. I'm not going to further bloody my fucking nipples because you want to control my life.\" She's not seeing it as a \"I want to be safe\" but rather a \"he's trying to tell me what I can and can't do\" thing. Admittedly this might be due to my wording (and due to the doctor telling her things are fine that I'm not okay with). Ex: she said she wanted a beer; I said \"you can't. Go pump first.\" I believe I had the same wording for the soda issue. She says she will go without her wants and needs being met and has made me feel guilty for asking her to pump because the doctor says it's okay and I'm just telling her what she can and cannot do at this point.

      "It ended up happening, and I mentioned it later to my friends. They were surprised because she‚Äôs not my usual type, and I agreed and just said I slept with her because when else will I get a chance to sleep with somebody who‚Äôs on a royal succession line somewhere? \n",
      "\n",
      "Most of them agreed it was a good experience, but one of my friends said it‚Äôs an AH move to sleep with somebody for ulterior motives. I don‚Äôt see it that way. She was into me, she got what she wanted, I wanted a cool story to tell somebody, I got what I wanted, everybody‚Äôs happy.\n",

      "In my province if you are caught speeding 50 km or more above the speed limit, you get a roadside suspension and automatically have your driver's licence suspended for 30 days. If you get convicted there is a fine of up $10,000 and you can also get up to 6 months in prison and another licence suspension separate from the roadside one. The police also tow and impound the car you are driving for 14 days. It does not matter if you own the car or not, the law is that your car gets impounded. The one and only exception to this under the law is if the car was stolen.\n",

      "My older brother got pulled over for speeding 57 km over the limit. He was driving our younger brother's car. Me and my mom and my stepdad and even some other family said we would all chip in and pay the impound fees and we would loan him one of our cars for my younger brother for the 2 weeks. Instead he reported the car as stolen because our brother borrowed it without asking him (again). \n",

      "So now in addition to the 2 charges for speeding and stunt driving in the province court, my older brother was also hit with a theft of a motor vehicle charge in the criminal court. He's never been arrested before and doesn't have a criminal record. This was his first time being pulled over even.

We had the impound fee situation covered and he would have had a car for the 2 weeks.

However, even though my husband doesn't live across the country, it would still be a four hour drive and we would both be exhausted. Her coach is strict and definitely would not be happy. In addition, competition requires focus and I know that if my daughter leaves, she won't be able to focus. her coach might even say that we might as well just not compete then.\n",

      "It was a tough decision, but I decided that my daughter shouldn't go. I tried to get her to focus with her coach, but she became very upset- she's wiser than her years.

But it seems to be less so the case now and when we are home my husband sometimes sleeps on the couch by his own volition. AITA for the sacrifices I am making?

      "One of my conditions was that we should get married before the birth of the baby so to have some kind of security for me (having the baby would mean my career would take a hit financially, etc.). He thought it wasn't romantic or his idea of a dream wedding to have a quick wedding before the birth, so for my peace of mind we ended up going to a notary and getting a contract that ressembled what ties people when they get married.

They talk about me in their messages. They even talk about how she‚Äôs fucking around with some other guy. I‚Äôm just very uncomfortable that he confides in her about problems in our relationship. He talks to her about it but doesn‚Äôt confide in me. He told me he just needs someone else to confide in. But I‚Äôm not sure why that can‚Äôt be me who he confides in.

Naturally, I voiced for my dog, saying, \"Could you please step back, your making my dog uncomfortable\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The woman didn't say anything as her kid reached out to pet Juniper, who at this point was starting to growl. I voiced my concerns, saying, \"you can't pet her, she bites\" tugging my dog away from the kids reach, the kid started throwing a hissy fit as he started screaming and crying. The womans face was red, she screamed at me, \"How DARE you?!\" I was baffled. \"How dare you not let my son pet your dog! He has every right to!\" I kept my composure, \"ma'am, not only did he try to pet MY dog without permission, I also stated that she bites\" I said calmly, while my dogs growling wasn't getting quieter. \"I don't care, let my son pet your dog or I'm calling the cops!\" Now, this was what kind of scared me, even though I knew it was a bluff. \"I already told you!\" I said, wrapping my dog's leash around my wrist, \"She's a very agressive dog, of your son tries to pet him she will bite!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I doubt a fluffy dog would hurt anybody! Haven't you heard of the bigger the dog, the kinder they are!?\" She was screaming at this point, attracting the attention of alot of people. \"I know, and that's not the case of all dogs-\" I tried to speak but the Karen got in my face and it took all my strength to hold my now barking dog back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fine, he can pet her, but if she bite-\" before I could finish my sentence, the Karen's son tears had dried up and he was reaching out once again to pet Juniper. Juniper suddenly lurched forward and bit the kids hand, I was dragged slightly  forward, the kid started screaming, and I commanded Juniper to let go, which she obliged. The Karen screamed bloody murder at the bite mark on her son's hand, \"Your dog just bit my son!\" She screamed as if it weren't obvious, \"I told you she bites, that's on you, it's your fault your son got hurt\" I promptly turned on my heel and left.\n",

      "During the dissolution of my 20 year marriage, I started seeing a friend who was also married. We were 'together' for the last 4years of my marriage, which ended a few years ago. It was implied that we might end up together, once he ended his marriage, which he claims was all but over, once his youngest graduated from high school. I felt as though every time I tried to get answers from him about our future, he was vague. He would say \"I would like for us to be together but I don't have a blueprint for that\", and things like that.  Never anything particularly definitive. Which I tried to respect, because he's married and there are other people involved. A few times over the course of the relationship, I told him we needed to end things, and he always talked me out of it. Several months ago, I told him I couldn't do this for three more years.  We had an emotional conversation, but at the end of it, he told me he understood and that he would always love me and hold me in high regard.  He then left his key to my apartment on the counter, and left.  I sat on the floor and sobbed.  He came back into the apartment, saying he wanted to grab a water, and we talked for a minute.  Then we had sex, he said \"this isn't over until I say it's over\", which he knew I would enjoy hearing.\n",

So I guess I figured I would just do what I want since I wasn't getting what I wanted, and deal with the repercussions later.  The repercussions came, no surprise.  I was at a store with guy #2 and ran into guy #1. So the truth came out over the next couple of days during discussion with guy #1, and I ended things with guy #2. I also tried to end things with guy #1, a few times.  Guy #1 was insistent that we could work through things and that it would be a process. I started to feel as though I was missing something before, and that he actually really wants to be with me. We have had several discussions about what our future looks like, and I feel like maybe we just weren't communicating well before...? So guy #1 feels severely disrespected, but what I want to know is, I already know I'm seriously in the wrong for bringing guy #2 into it, but how badly have I wronged guy #1?\n",

      "I (15F) am now a sophomore at my high school, in the begging of middle school I was friends with most of the gay kids in my school since I am bisexual myself. I was friends with one of them in 6th-9th grade, and there were a lot of ups and downs with our relationship but I always made up with them. So not too long ago the school year ended and there was this one person that I‚Äôll call P. P and I had an okay relationship but they didn‚Äôt know what boundaries were and I always reminded them about what I was comfortable with. But they rarely followed them but I just rolled with it because I didn‚Äôt want to start an argument over it. After the day ended I got on the bus there were a lot of kids that were going to baseball or softball practice so I took any available seat. P was behind me, yelling that ‚ÄúNobody takes my seat‚Äù P normally sits in the last seat that can hold 2 to 3 people so I sat in the seat across from the one that they normally sit in, so then P comes in and starts screaming at me to get out of their seat and I say this isn‚Äôt your seat, though you can‚Äôt own a seat, but they were acting like a child and started manhandling me by pulling on my backpack and screaming at me to get out They then proceeded to hit me in the head with a plastic bag filled with food. And then, this girl behind us finally tells us to calm down but I still refused to get out of the seat, so P start hitting me harder and pulling on my arm, and if that wasn‚Äôt enough they then started, digging their nails into my arm, I stood up and raised my arm, like I was going to punch him, but I took a deep breath and sat right down, and then he finally sat down. So p identifies as transgender he uses he they pronouns, I respect, pronouns, and whatever your sexuality is, but I then said, ‚ÄúShe was the one who was hitting me in the head with a bag of food like a maniac that she is ‚Äú while this was all happening the other kids on my bus were cheering me on saying that I should smack them in the mouth. My best friend was just sitting there laughing her ass off. ÔøºNow before you come at me, saying that I am homophobic or transphobic I am, part of the LGBTQ-plus community, like I stated earlier Ôøºand I am friends with a lot of trans and other people that are a part of the community. P then went on to tell their sibling that I am a homophobic and transphobic motherless bitch ÔøºI tried to reason with them, and I did apologize for not getting out of the seat, but they just laughed, and then I just put in my headphonesÔøº because they then started just harassing me. I could probably handle the situation more maturely, but I was sick of his behavior. The next day they tried to come up to me and act as if we were buddies I was still fuming with anger, so I walked away and ignored them throughout the day. I tried apologizing, but he did not want my apology and I‚Äôm still waiting on his. This is my first-ever post in first ever. And an ‚ÄúAm I The Asshole‚Äù I am not proud of how I acted and I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm making up any excuses, so am I the asshole? Ôøº\n",

      "Throwaway account. No issues with any human being for being who they want to be as long as it doesn‚Äôt hurt me. I tend to err on live and let live philosophy. I have an internal struggle though, so before I proceed with breaking this credo, I wondered what the good people of Reddit thought. My first year high school student was recently assigned to read the  story ‚ÄúCatch, Pull, Drive‚Äù from the book ‚Äú[Fresh Ink](https://www.netgalley.com/book/127258/reviews#:~:text=Catch%2C%20Pull%2C%20Drive%20by%20Schuyler,trans%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20swimmer)‚Äù and annotate each of the six pages. In preparation they watched a [TED talk](https://youtu.be/HbQZ7jAvgoI?si=s1iJw5J5rSmxhFDr) with Jackson Bird. I‚Äôm uncertain how to feel about it but my initial reaction is that there‚Äôs probably more effective means of teaching a subject without involving a somewhat polarizing matter. My student has expressed frustration over the assignment as they disagree with the idea of schools being politically leaning/influenced, regardless of the leaning. The same would hold true if the teacher assigned any right-leaning ideology. It‚Äôs the principle that matters, in their own words. The assignment was completed but I feel the annotations were more focused on the fact that it was about a transgender person than an exercise in teasing out the key parts of the story. My question is: should we discuss with his teacher for an understanding of why this particular reading was assigned and our student‚Äôs difficulty with it? Would that make me the AH?\n",

I said I wouldn't feel comfortable with it at all, and he sent back, \"Just about everybody else in the world has moved on. You need to as well.\" Most people in the group text, with a couple of them being ER nurses, said I had nothing to worry about, that my continued isolation is unhealthy, and that I should see a therapist because it could be trauma from the pandemic. I told them that I have every right to protect myself from a deadly illness, considering that I'm high risk. I also added that even if I was completely healthy, I'd still be practicing my precautions out of solidarity with those who have been negatively impacted by COVID, such as people of color, the elderly, and other high risk people. My brother said, \"Okay, this is obviously virtue signaling. We've all gotten boosted, and if we haven't, we'll get boosted to minimize your risk. Even though you haven't had asthma since you were like 6. Regardless, this is my house. You don't get to keep banning visitors. 3 years is too long of this, and I'm done bending over backwards for you. If you have a problem with that, get a hotel room for a few days.\" I told my brother he had no right to speak to me that way because this could be a matter of life and death, and he sent, \"No. We've compromised with you enough. If you want to be a hermit so bad, go to school, get a real job, and get your own place.\"\n",

I have math homework every night (Calculus) and work on it on the ground in my small bedroom that I share with her as I have no desk (she took it for herself) and the dining  room table is too small for my laptop and paper work. Almost every single night she takes a shower and wraps a towel around herself and walks into my bedroom to get changed.  The thing is I find it highly inappropriate and am sick of having to interrupt my focus to move for her.  My parents don't seem to care, but I do it makes me uncomfortable. Also if I try to change in the bedroom I'm always walked in on by everyone... it's like I have no privacy. So I do bring my clothes into the bathroom to change. I made my normal complaints and was dismissed as usual... then because she doesn't ever pay attention to her surroundings kicked my hand. I got pulled out of my room and had an argument with my dad.  I said when I'm an adult this cannot fly.  I honestly don't want to be labeled a pedophile.  My dad replied that hell just kick me out of my room as it will no longer be my room I just exist there.  Then continued to say he and mom pay for the apartment, so I can just leave.  I told him that's ridiculous. He then threatened to take my phone off the plan... I need my phone for school and can't turn things in without it.  He then tried sending me to bed not caring about the fact that I still have homework. So AITHA?\n",

      "A little backstory.. I've been with my girlfriend for 12 years. We were high school sweethearts and I love and loved her with all heart. She went off to the US for her degree 7 years ago and we've been in a long distance relationship since. she hasn't visited once in the 7 years. Long distance was never a problem for us because we used to talk everyday and tell each other everything. However, she never liked to video chat and even when we did she always showed me the top of her head or sth like that. I wanted to see her but I was fine with it cause she isn't very comfortable with a camera pointing at her, I was just happy hearing her voice at the end of usually a long ass day. I, being a guy always had urges but I never put her in a position where she might have felt uncomfortable (like sending noods or videos) even though I sometimes persuaded her to. It was all good, we were growing separately in our careers knowing one day we'll end up together. \n",
      "The problem came when my father sadly passed away couple of months ago. He had a brain stroke and went into a vegetative state for 11 days. It was the most darkest time of my life. I'm still coping from it. All I wanted to do was curl up in a ball and cry because I had never felt so useless and helpless in my life. My father was a power figure for me and I went to him on any decision I had doubts on. Now that he was gone I felt such a huge void in my life that I felt like I was ripping apart. I wanted my girlfriend to come back to my country so that I could just have someone to hold and be my rock. I just wanted someone to hold my hand. \n",
      "But she told me that her paperwork was not in place and she'd get deported if she came back. She's in the process of getting a green card so her visa situation is a bit crazy. I understood but I was very sad, so I just dropped it cause I didn't want to get into anything that would bring me disappointment in a time where I was feeling like a disappointment. Now after my father passed away all I wanted from my girlfriend was words of comfort and understanding. But it was such a huge emotional trauma that I don't think she could comprehend what I went through. Plus with the distance and me not talking to her daily to let her know what was going on really brought a lot of unknowns to her. But I kept on expecting something from her.. some words or something to make me feel better. I get it that she's far away and there's nothing much that she can do. But I just wanted her to do what she could. Whenever we talked she wanted me to tell her things but to tell her I had to relieve all the trauma I faced. So I just didn't want to tell her. It was horrible to experience everything just to tell her what happened. But the thing was even when I told her things I didn't get the response I felt like I deserved from a person I loved with all my heart for 12 years. I told her that I decided to pull the plug on my father because there was no way of him ever waking up from the coma. She told me \"It'll be okay. You'll get through it.\" This was the response that she gave. I know that's what you're supposed to say but am I an AH for expecting something not so general? Her reply was something that a someone I just met might say which broke me. I felt like she didn't know me at all and she couldn't cope with me being an emotional mess. She kept asking me \"what she could do?\" And I kept saying \"nothing\". Because I didn't want to tell her what to do. It was something she needed to figure out on her own. It's like when girls want flowers but they won't say they want flowers cause they want the flowers to be given to them without asking. I overlooked everything and I kept giving her chances.\n",

When I told my girlfriend this, she offered me money. Which really hurt my ego for some reason. And that's when I decided to end it. I'm already going through such large amounts of stress on a daily basis. I can become homeless at any moment if the bank wishes to do so. I didn't want her to be with a man who would bring her down with his debt. She deserves a man who can make her happy. Bring her out of her shell. I don't think I could ever do that.

It‚Äôs a genetic thing. I‚Äôve been doing a good job managing it over my life for the most part and I‚Äôve been to date the most patient and most controlled offspring over my anger.

I didn‚Äôt honk or get mad or anything, but stayed pretty close to her bumper since at this point she was still at least 10-15 mph below. There‚Äôs now at least six cars behind me all stacked up because of this woman. Then she decided to brake check me. Fine, she‚Äôs a moron, don‚Äôt engage. We start driving up a steep hill, still very slowly. Then she brake checks me again, and she‚Äôs still 10 under the limit. I‚Äôm pretty pissed off now because she‚Äôs causing stupid traffic because of how slow she‚Äôs going and she‚Äôs sandwiching me between two cars, so I couldn‚Äôt even back off her bumper if I wanted to. Then she brake checks me a third time and I‚Äôve had it. \n",

I yelled something to her out the window, but I‚Äôm not gonna step out and walk up on somebody to argue, idk if they‚Äôve got guns and I‚Äôd end up getting killed over it. She sits there silently for a while and then yells something but I can‚Äôt hear over the sound of other cars.

His fianc√© messaged me on IG ( don‚Äôt know how she found my profile) and asked me if I spoke with him and I said ‚Äú no I don‚Äôt keep in touch with exes. I haven‚Äôt spoke to him in years.‚Äù And that was true. After our breakup we never talked to each other again as we wanted a clean break,‚Äù she let me know that they were getting married and I said congrats but damn it hit me hard. I haven‚Äôt been thinking about him in so long so I don‚Äôt know why I felt a wash of sadness come over me. \n",

      "I (33M, single) have been looking to start a family since graduating from college at 23. I've never been a bar/club kind of guy and don't have many social hobbies, so I tried the online thing for a while but was never able to make a solid connection with any female that was actually attractive.\n",

      "About six weeks ago a new woman started attending my church. She looked mid to late 20's, decently pretty face, a little rough-looking with a lip piercing and arm tattoos but whatever, that didn't bother me. She had a kid with her (6-7) but no husband/boyfriend so I assumed single mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shows up three weeks in a row and on the third Sunday I finally work up the nerve to speak with her and ask if she'd like to hang out outside of church sometime. She agrees and suggests mini-golf. So we meet the following Saturday and she's got her kid with her. I expected her to come alone so I was kind of annoyed right off the bat but I tried to play it cool. Unfortunately this little jackass was constantly pulling her attention away any time I tried to speak to her. And he kept trying to talk to me about video game nonsense, which I had to try my hardest to pretend to care about. Take a hint, kid. I'm here to get to know your mom, not to play daddy for the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following Saturday we're at my place after going for ice cream and the kid wants to watch tv so I give her the remote and go to the washroom. When he's finished I turn the tv off and notice smudges and fingerprints across the screen. Normally I wouldn't mind, but this is a friggin $2000 OLED. Dumb kid must have thought it was a touch screen or something and put his hands all over it when I was in the other room.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, I'm already pretty pissed at his incessant commentary the entire time I've been on my 'date', so this just pushes me right over the edge. I ask him calmly if he touched the screen, and he says no, but he's obviously lying, so I lose my cool and raise my voice and he starts crying so the mom gets pissed and walks out. Really unfortunate because I was quite attracted to her but it wouldn't have worked out with the kid anyways.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day I'm shocked to see she shows up to church again with her kid. She knew I was going to be there and it was going to be super awkward so I don't know what she was trying to prove. I'm teaching Sunday school and this kid is in my class and being loud and disruptive. I give him several warnings and he wouldn't shut up so I hit him (open-palm) in the back of his head. Physically disciplining someone else's child is not uncommon at our church, and I only hit him hard enough to get his attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kid starts crying hysterically and runs up the stairs and next thing I know the mom comes down and starts cussing me out, calling me every name under the sun (in front of kids mind you!) She's so loud, the rest of the congregation comes running down the stairs and she's just going ballistic. I was so mortified with embarrassment I couldn't even speak. The pastor had to escort her out while she's threatening to call the police. It was insane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it's been a couple weeks and I'm still so embarrassed I haven't been able to bring myself to return to church. I feel like that was such a low-life thing for her to do to make a huge scene in front of the entire church. It makes me feel physically ill just thinking about it.\n",

      "I've always been a very proud father. My son is the light of my life, and I've always tried to be supportive of him, even when he didn't fit the mold of what I had expected for him. But recently, I found out something that has been devastating to me and our family. I found out that my son has a huge foot fetish, and I just can't accept it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My son is 18 years old, and ever since he was a child, he's been a bit different from other kids. He was quirky and independent, and he never really fit in with the crowd. But I always supported him, and I encouraged him to be himself. I thought that we had a great relationship, and I was always there for him when he needed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when I found out about his foot fetish, everything changed. At first, I was just in shock and denial. I refused to believe that my son could be into something so unusual. But eventually, I was forced to confront the truth. And when I did, I realized that I just couldn't accept it. I was disgusted, and I felt like this was something that I just couldn't condone or support in my son. So I made the decision to disown him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, and it broke my heart to do it. But I felt like it was something that I had to do for my own peace of mind and for our family. I just couldn't see my son as the man that I had always believed him to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, I'm questioning my decision. I've spoken to some friends and family, and some of them have been supportive, while others have told me that I was wrong to disown him. And now, I'm starting to think that maybe I was too drastic and maybe I should have handled the situation differently.\n",

      "I (22F) recently got engaged to my boyfriend of 4 years, and we‚Äôre ecstatic! It just happens to be really unfortunate timing because my parents are in the middle of a nasty divorce from infidelity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it takes a lot of context about this situation to get the full picture. My mom (42) and dad (43) separated a year ago when he opened up about his ongoing affair. It‚Äôs particularly nasty, though, because his affair partner is my mom‚Äôs best friend since college (Chelsea). Chelsea was married to my dad‚Äôs childhood best friend (Tony). All four of them had been close for my whole life. My parents were the matron of honor and best man for Chelsea and Tony‚Äôs wedding, I was the flower girl. We would all go on trips together. I basically consider Chelsea and Tony to be like an aunt and uncle to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "The affair basically blew up all of our lives. My mom and Tony were absolutely, utterly betrayed. My dad and Chelsea are pretty happy together though. I obviously resent what they‚Äôve done, but I‚Äôve ‚Äúforgiven‚Äù them to an extent. I still spend time with them because they both mean so much to me and it would hurt too much to cut them out of my life. I think it‚Äôs been easy to forgive because my dad was being abused, he needed out. I really wish he would‚Äôve *appropriately* ended his marriage before moving on to a new partner, but I really feel like I can‚Äôt fault him for seeking that emotional connection when he was at his lowest and most alone. I honestly feel like everyone‚Äôs better off this way, even though we all had to go through hell to get here. He‚Äôs finally happier and more loved, and that‚Äôs really important to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I‚Äôm prone to ‚Äúforgive and forget‚Äù a lot faster than most normal people, and I think it might be too soon for the rest of my family if I were to include Chelsea in my big day. She has the stigma of being the affair partner and my mom‚Äôs former best friend turned homewrecker, but she‚Äôs also just my dad‚Äôs girlfriend. She‚Äôs my slightly awkward aunt/stepmom figure. And if I chose to not invite her, my dad would likely be somewhat alone and miserable throughout the ceremony and reception (his own mother wants nothing to do with him, just like the other side of my family).\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, I feel like if I withheld an invitation from my dad‚Äôs girlfriend, I would have to withhold an invitation from my mom‚Äôs boyfriend as well, who‚Äôs generally a well-liked figured (among those who know of his existence) and whom I also want to be part of the big day. My mom would also be a little miserable without her partner‚Ä¶ but I think she‚Äôd be even more miserable if she had to see Chelsea. (But also, my mom has made my dad‚Äôs and my life miserable for so long that my sympathy is rather weak. I want her to be an adult and be able to handle seeing Chelsea, but I do know that‚Äôs not fair because Chelsea hurt her so deeply and those wounds may never truly heal. Mom‚Äôs a bitch sometimes, but she‚Äôs human, and I do love her.)\n",
      "\n",
      "My fianc√© is fully aware of the whole situation and has been my rock and emotional support from the very start, but he doesn‚Äôt have a strong opinion on whether or not I should invite Chelsea. He understands that none of the potential options are ideal, but trusts me to find whatever solution I‚Äôm most comfortable with. \n",
      "\n",
      "So basically, I‚Äôm leaning towards inviting Chelsea because I want to, even though it would certainly hurt my mom (and my paternal grandmother, and anyone else in my family who hates her guts). WIBTA for inviting her?\n",

The space between us and the playground is a good two maybe two and a half basketball courts, and I‚Äôm refreshing his off-leash training with him by just walking and lighting tossing a ball in front of us, all the while an eye on him as well as watching the kids just to make sure that if they come towards us I can issue the right commands to him. \n",

      "She doesn‚Äôt know us, my dog wasn‚Äôt the one who attacked her child and just like she wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to assume her child is a shit, don‚Äôt assume my dog is vicious, and based on the overall first impression of the mother, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised IF her child was a shit and just ran up to or scared the dog. \n",

We talked for 3 months and before we got together i told him i was mentally ill (I was diagnosed with BPD) and he reassured me that he could handle me so then i gave it a shot. Its hard to find love with BPD. After a month of dating i was splitting (splitting is a defensive mechanism for people with BPD) i would argue with him over little things and get jealous easily and start an argument. I didnt mean for us to argue i just wanted to spend time with him and i‚Äôm aware i have attachment issues and jealousy problems. Everyday we would argue and he had work so he had almost no time for me. I was getting mad and complaining everyday how we spend little to no time together. before we dated i would always tell him my overthinking and he would comfort me but after we started dating that went away, he would just listen then ignore it. around 3 weeks ago i overdosed because just couldnt take life anymore (other stuff were happening) I survived and had a brain injury then  recently 6 days ago i was diagnosed with melanoma. I havent told him because we spent no time together at this point. 4 days ago he broke up with me, my eyes filled with tears, i lost another part of me. SJ assured me it wasn‚Äôt because of my brain injury and i knew it was because of every single thing about me.. we came to a conclusion to stay as friends. Today i saw a tiktok about this girl breaking up with her boyfriend using chat gbt and the paragraph looked a like to what he sent me. thats when it hit me, he used chat gbt to break up with me. i confronted him and he apologized but it didnt seem sincere.

      "Yesterday Me (19M) and my sister (22F) had a huge argument. Long story short it was about her covering something out of her pocket for one of my friends with her work discount and get paid back later. She was hesitant at the fact that why she had to do this for one of my friends before she got paid by my friend because of her argument \"What is your friend to me?\" Why is her relation to my friend is relevant if shes getting paid back in full anyways????? She also literally offered to me to offer friends discount on stuff through her. Wouldn't it also make sense to get paid after the fact too because why would my friend pay her if he didnt get the thing yet? Anyways, she bought the thing after a text argument with me concluding with me saying for her to not buy it and i'll just tell my friend you forgot cause shes making this is a way bigger deal than it should've been. For the record this is some of the stupidest bullshit ever, I am still in disbelief how it snowballed and escalated. She ends up buying the item and comes home, opens my room door and throws it on the ground then shuts my door promptly. Petty, but appropriate considering we just had a text-fight. I'm playing a video game and I notice what she did but I leave the bag there for a sec and continue before I pick it up. I take the item out and also in the bag I notice that my sister forgot her food in there. I set the bag back down. She momentarily bursts into my room, grabs her food out of the bag, and throws the bag disrespectfully for the second time. I smack the bag before it hits the ground towards her inbetween the door to jam it before it could close and hit her in the chin with one of the straps. She catches the bag and throws it at my head. This is where I admit I lost my shit. I went up in her face screaming at the top of my lungs butting heads, threatening her that if she keeps acting up one of these fucking days i'd fuck her up. For the record I did not lay a hand on her other than stepping on her by accident briefly while running up to her. Dad comes up, and tries to mediate the situation. I literally let her speak without interruption (I interrupted once briefly out of anger) because what can she possibly say to defend herself.\n",

Fuck that, I was raised in western society with all the resources that taught me how to think for myself and build my own moral compass and backbone instead of being a pussy brainwashed drone that mindlessly entertains the idea of respecting elders no matter what and takes disrespect. I'm not supposed to take that shit from nobody. My mom is also not home because she travelled overseas to see my terminally ill grandma who just passed. This will be important for later\n",

My dad concludes with the verdict that both of us have valid points but then goes on an entire tangent about how I need to control myself and how he hates my personality when I'm angry. How the fuck he isn't disciplining the one who threw the fucking bag at my head. I do not lack self awareness. If I get angry I admit I do go fucking crazy yelling at the top of my lungs but I do not instigate or seek out conflict, I just respond 10x when someone crosses a line, and also since this was my sister I would not ever use violence (I punched her in the face 1 time in the eigth grade). Me and him end up butting heads and it spirals to the point where me and my dad arguing about shit and some of the shit that he's done wrong in my eyes, and then he ends up going downstairs and responds from an incoming call from my mom overseas. He starts bitching and moaning saying \"how their kids are so hopeless and disrespectful and make him so sad\". This fucking pisses me off because my mom's mom just passed. That is why she travelled. he couldn't suck this shit up to himself until at least she comes back from overseas. I went out with friends shortly after I was getting ready as I heard him on the phone. He asks me if I need anything to which I respond \"No.\" I did not raise my voice I just said no and left. This interraction can be seen as disrespectful in my culture I guess cause I kind of brushed my dad off mannerlessly but he pissed me off by telling my mom.\n",

Then I said \"Dude you are so in the wrong for putting more shit on mom's plate when her mom just passed.\" then left his room. This is where it gets fucking wild. My dad shortly calls my mom and says he wants a divorce and to sell the house and for our family to go our seperate ways. My mom calls me fucking crying saying \"what have you done, what have you done, i told you not to argue with your dad while I was gone\". She ended up saying that she was just gonna stay overseas and not come back, then ended the call.\n",

I actually recommend taking her to the ER bc I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever actually started to shake from pain because of her period & I got worried. She said ‚ÄúBabe no the ER is going to charge us a leg and a arm just to prescribe me over the counter drugs but I know what you can do‚Äù I asked her what it was & she said‚Äùlet‚Äôs do it on my period‚Äù I chuckled a little and asked if she was serious & she said yea. I asked her if there was anything else I can do asked if I could just go to Spencer‚Äôs and get her a toy but she said she wanted the real thing. I told her that We will make a mess on our white sheets *which cost a large amount of money* she said that we can just put a towel down. I figured she wasn‚Äôt letting this go so I was honest I explained that I am not 100% comfortable having intercourse while blood is coming out of you. I even said if it was just spotting it would be a different story but this is her heaviest day & it is not something I want to do. She  grabbed my hand & told me she needed this release & that as a man I should go above and beyond to help her when she‚Äôs cramping since I will never experience this. I told her half of the stuff I do for her while she‚Äôs cramping other women have to BEG their man to do & I do it out of the kindness of my heart. But having intercourse is crossing boundaries that we clearly need to set. She called me a misogynistic asshole & that she‚Äôs asking for the bare minimum.

      "Hey guys I'm having a serious moral conflict. Recently, I (28 M) and my girlfriend (20 f) bought a very nice house together. I make good money and her upbringing has always been much lower income, as she is from a military family that has relied on military housing and all that to have somewhere permanent to stay. This has been a big difference in the way she was raised and she has appreciated every second of what we've done for each other. The problem starts with her sister (19 f). Her military parents have recently moved across the country to be at a different military base and we gave her sister the option to move in with us and she can begin her own life where she can begin to make her own choices. We purchase everything for her, she gets to pick out whatever she wants from any grocery store when we go, no rent, she doesn't even have to buy her own vapes. The intention of her moving in was to better herself and get her life on track and make better decisions. The issue became clear one week after she moved in with us. She informed us she would be hanging out in a very secluded area with a 24 year old male who has no car, no phone, she had met once, has been homeless multiple times, and he has permanent STDs. We were reluctant, but after swearing to us she wouldn't spend the night with this guy, we were overall okay with her spending time with this person. It was only a few hours later that we had recieved a text at 8 p.m. saying that she was too tired to drive home and would be spending the night with this guy. Almost immediately tension spiked. We told her we were not okay with that and that she would need to come home immediately. She did not. She spent the night with him. We use the same bathroom, the same toilet, the same cups, the same wash rags, everything. After this had happened, we gave her the ultimatum to either get tested in two weeks, have the test result come back negative and she stops talking to this guy and we move on with our happy lives, or she can keep talking to him and spending the night with him, drastically risking our chances of contracting whatever he has, and she can get out. She would be on her own and the rest of her family is across the country. Am I the asshole?\n",

      "I [21f] went out to a bar the other night with a bunch of my friends. When it was my turn to order drinks, a guy came up to me I was standing at the counter and we started chatting. I told him I had a boyfriend [24m], and made it clear that I wasn‚Äôt interested in him like that. He offered to pay for my drinks anyway and I accepted. When I told my boyfriend about it yesterday he got really angry with me and told me I shouldn‚Äôt have let him. Am I in the wrong here?\n",

My female friends actually joke all the time about how they think pretty Michael is and how they think he is actually transgender. So anyway, one weekend Michael was just lying on his bed reading his textbook. I came into his room, and closed the door behind me and locked it. There was a struggle, but basically I cut the back of his hair so that it was just shoulder-length, not going all the way to his back. He's still a long-haired pretty guy. He tried screaming and yelling for help but I covered his mouth while I was cutting his hair. To this day he is still pissed off at me and doesn't ever want to be alone with me. Whenever he IS alone with me, he more or less shuts down completely. I keep telling him that he can live without a few inches of hair. AITA?\n",

      "I (21m) went on a holiday  trip with my family a few months ago in the summer for 4 weeks. While there i hooked up with this girl (23f) on a datting app a few times. We Kept in contact for about a week after i went back home (england) but stopped messgaing eachother as we both went back to our usual lives. Two days ago she Dm me on instagra (we shared each other insta) that she was pregnant and the baby was probably mine.I gave her my whatsapp so we could talk. I told her I was her happy for her but the baby was unlikley mine and even if it was i didn't want to be a fahter so young. She started getting mad and told me I had no choice and I had to USA (nyc) and help her with the child. I asked her how she knew it was mine as we slept togother months ago. She told be she did a paternity test on the only other person (male roomate) she had slept with in the last few months and it came back negative so by her logic it must be mine. I told her she had no evidence and i was not traveling back to nyc just to be spme parent. I hung up and went to sleep as this call was late at night for me. When i woke up i had crazy amounts of messages from her. I wasn't bothered to read  most of them so i just called her so i just called her. She some how answered quickly and we began to talk. he told me i didn't have to come back but i would have no choice but to provide for my \"child\". she said she couldn't aford to have a baby without help. I suggested abort it but she didn't want to. She told me i could help her out now or provide child support when the child was born. I told her without a paternity test she couldn't prove the child was even mine. She started shouting saying i  was rich ( my parents are rich not me) and i could easily help her out and if i didn't she would go to court. This went on for about 6 minutes before i hung up.  blocked her on all social media. I know there is omething called the hague convention that inforces international child support but i have no intention to pay even if the child is mine. She has no way to prove the child is mine, She doesn't know here i live. She only knows i'm from england. I feel a bit guilty but i realy don't want to be a father. I only told my brother(20m) about this and he thinks it is funny  By the way i did offter to pay for the abortion but she refused. so AITA for ignoring her.\n",

While we would be their i would need to actually confirm she was pregnant by her booking a doctor appointment. She told me she had no problem as long as i was paying (cheapskate). Then she began talking about what gender \"our\" baby could be or what \"we\" should name it. I didn't want to get more invloved that i was already am so i said goodbye and see you on tuesday. I really don't want to involve my parrents or any lawyers until i can confirm she is pregnant as i don't need the hassle this is already causing. Also even if i end up paying i will make sure it is the lowest amount pssible by uk law. i will defintely not be following the bulshit usa law.

I will give away away my rights and try to pay the lowest amount possible tbh. If anything my goal is to still pay nothing\n",
      "\n",
      "update 4: I thought I would answer a few question as I won't be updating again untill I am in NYC. The reason why I am flying there myself is because I want to see the test myself. I have already talked to an attorney and they have started to explain the process that I need to go throught right now. I have already accepted that if this child is mine that I will be paying some sort of child support. The question I want to know is how much. Just to clarify my parents got rich while I was growing up so it's not like I had a golden spoon in my mouth all my life. I do understand what poverty is at a young age and I will do anything to protect my status I have now. To the people telling me I'm awful for leaving this child without a father I accept how cruel I am right now. Though I don't want to be a father right now. Anyway one of the biggest issue I really have is that I don't want this child growing up in poverty but I also don't want to be putting money in this GOLDDIGGER pockets. Makes me horrible that I'm willing to pay the lowest possible. well that is life I guess. Thank you for the people who see my side of the story. I just needed to vent\n",

      "update 5: I have already landed in NYC with my brother and have been talking to my attorney for the last hour right now. Tbh I'm starting to feel way more confident about this dumbfounded situation then I was yesterday. I have a doctor appointment with the GOLDDIGGER tomorrow to actually see is she is even pregnant. Then after that I will take the paternity test which I'm honestly dreading. The worst thing so far tbh is that when I called her to mention I was already in NYC she wanted to invite me out to dinner with her parents. I told her no and said we would meet tomorrow at the hospital. I would not feel safe to be at her place.. I am actually interested if you can tell the gender of a baby at 3 months. Anyway I'm still here wanting to pay zero to little child support no matter what out comes. I may have helped make the baby but she chose to keep it so she can pay for it. The amount I should pay based on UK law is ¬£294( $337.44) a week or ¬£1,273.02($1461.31) but my plan is to reduce this as much as possible. It is literally Robbery that I have to pay ¬£15276($17,539.37) per year for the next 18yrs of my life for a unwanted baby who will live in another country. for fusksake this is unfair\n",

      "update 6: I was very busy yesterday and just fell asleep before I could update on this tragic story. My brother and I went to the private hospital to finally check if she was pregnant yesterday though when we finally arrived we saw her talking too  some old people. In a matter of seconds we found out they were her parents  I unwantedly said hello but my brother refused. I think they took that personally and greeted the both of us with some what of a rude attitude. Tbh I was taken a back that they had no manners to say hello kindly. I didn't really care so I walked pass them to say my hello to Ava (fake name for the women) and ask her if she was ready. we didn't have to wait long before the Sonographer was ready for all of us  but before we could all stand up the receptionist said only one of us could be in the room with Ava. Before I could say anything va mother stood up and said it was fin as she was going. I straight away got up and told her no as the only reason I was even here was to see if she was even pregnant. She began to argue with me saying that she was Ava mother and it was her right to be in the room with her daughter. I told her to shut up and sit down as I was in no mood to argue. The doctor receptionist interrupted us and began saying it was Ava choice not ours. I looked at Ava and said \" the only reason I'm here was to see if you are. even pregnant and I needed to be in the room with you. She nodded and began comforting her annoying mother. long story short, the Sonographer showed me and Ava the baby on the ultrasound. We also took a paternity test which I didn't enjoy. After all of this Ava looked at me and said if  I was happy. I told her I would only be happy when this is all over and I get the result I want. I took all the information I got from that day and just left with my brother. I will be receiving the paternity test in less than a week. It will only be sent to me. Before I end this the sonography did say she was likely pregnant with a girl. I will update when I have the paternity test back\n",

This isn‚Äôt too weird as I do have a lvl 3 diploma in sports massages. So he‚Äôs sort of like sat between my legs and I‚Äôm giving him a backrub.

She assumed I‚Äôd told him I don‚Äôt wanna talk and he‚Äôd felt embarrassed. I go to check my phone and I have a bombardment of texts, all basically saying how much of a POS I am etc. The guy then all of a sudden comes downstairs, says he didn‚Äôt realise the time and had to go as he wanted to go to the gym.

I took to twitter (as I had no way to know exactly who/how many people he had messaged) and exposed his cheating, as well as the vile messages he had been sending me since, and when the full truth  came out a most of our mutual friends cut him off. The whole situation apparently has severely damaged his mental health, and he has been spiralling, and apparently mentioning ‚Äúending it all‚Äù.I know this because his sister decided to get on my case and start calling me cruel for ‚Äúruining his life‚Äù, she also accused me of trying to sabotage any chance of future relationships by making him out to be an awful partner publicly.\n",

      "I (early 30's) live next to playground. It's a small neigborhood were most people get along. My children (7M&5F) play in this park unsupervised as I can easily check on them from the windows of my living room.

It got me in a state of panic and I spent hours cleaning it. I didn't manage to talk her as she ran out after using it, but told my children to not allow anyone else to tag along with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next time it happened she did use the downstair one as I blocked the stairs. She didn't even ask just said she was quickly taking a wizz. Her being a stranger and using the guest toilet gives me anxiety. I spent about an hour cleaning that after she left. \n",

      "The third time she used my guest toilet she came without my children because she has learned that my house door is unlocked. I only noticed when she came into the kitchen to pick up an apple for a snack and asked for some water to drink.

She said she had let it slide that I had told her daughter off in the past, but it was rude of me to say no to her in person. I tried to explain that I wasn't comfortable and that there are bushes in the park so it shouldn't be such a big deal. She got more angry and accused me of being a pervert. She said what kind of mother would allow someone elses daughter be taken pictures of while peeing/shitting in the park. Everyone has cameras on their phones these days and her daughter would end up on some sick site. I told her no again and locked the door.\n",

      "I guess she has been vocal about it. On Sunday some of the mothers I know confronted me about it in the park. They said it was wrong of me to not allow a child some snacks and use of my toilets.  It takes a village after all and if they were in my position they would. It's only a child and how much mess could she make. I asked them why they don't accomodate her by taking her home to themselves everytime she needs a snack or the toilet and they said we live further away. It has caused a rift in this group that my children hang out with. \n",

Few days ago we were hanging out. My girlfriend never liked him because she thinks he is a sexist dude. I think it is because he made a joke about her promotion and she overreacted even though he made it clear that he was joking. So, when we were hanging out my friend was complaining how his roommate doesn't do the dishes and he always has to do it. He then pointed at my girlfriend and said, \"you are lucky that you have your personal dishwasher, am I right?\" I thought it was funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think I messed up a bit. Because I added, \"Don't be fooled. She doesn't come cheap. I have to buy her dinner dates and expensive shit for that.\" I think my girlfriend got angry and said I shouldn't complain about gold diggers because if all women went for personality and looks I would still be a virgin. So I should be thankful. She took it too far and told my friend that for someone who complains about being single a lot he really doesn't put effort into being likeable at all. She added that my friend is going to die alone because he is an obnoxious creep who thinks women only exists to give men sex. If he continues to be a misogynist cunt he will be single for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got home, we had a fight. I did apologize for my joke but she didn't have to personally attack me or my friend. She is taking a little joke too seriously. I wanted her to apologize to my friend. But she says, she did nothing wrong and he needs to be put in his place. She told me she will not say sorry for being right and that I am an asshole for supporting my friend. Was I wrong?\n",

      "I (24 F) have a partner (30 M) who is poly and I knew this coming into the relationship and I was completely fine with it. We have done many sexual and nonsexual activities with people we trust in the time I‚Äôve known him. When he started looking for a gf he had one girl in mind so i let him run with it until one day she asked him for a larger amount of money to put as a down payment on a vehicle and a ride to another city.  He asked me what I thought about it after we had a conversation earlier that morning about how we needed to save money all around. Atp we had a daughter on the way and I was around 6/7 months pregnant and this girl is stunning she works out, she‚Äôs blonde, blue eyes, taller, and just all around he type from the time I met him. I am a short, brunette with brown eyes, and on the petite side. When I told him that I would explain to her that it just wasn‚Äôt in the budget at the time but give her a ride to whatever city he flew off the handle and didn‚Äôt talk to me for the rest of the day. I would text; no answer, call; no answer, and around 5 pm that day he calls me to say that I shouldn‚Äôt have told him what to do with his money and that I would learn when to be quiet so I tried to tell him that wasn‚Äôt the case he simply asked what I would do and I told him. I then asked him where he was and all he said was bye (my name) about 3-4 times and then hung up. He spent the whole day with her out of spite because he assumed I was trying to tell him what to do instead of what I would do like he asked. \n",
      "\n",
      "so AITA for not wanting to have a poly relationship because he started to show her how nice he can be but still be rude to me while pregnant with his child?

My family responded exactly how I expected, I was ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù ‚Äúbeing so dramatic‚Äù ‚Äúhe was just drunk he didn‚Äôt actually do anything‚Äù etc. my parents refuse to go to therapy or recognize anything saying ‚Äúone day you‚Äôll be married as long as us if you‚Äôre lucky and then you‚Äôll understand‚Äù.  I was livid at the time, but now I‚Äôm just heartbroken and disappointed. My husband has lost all respect for my stepdad and the rest of my family, he told me that he will do whatever I ask of him during family events if I wish to attend, but if my stepdad makes one questionable step he won‚Äôt be able to stop himself from putting a man in his place and ‚Äúit won‚Äôt be calm or pretty‚Äù.

      "\n",
      "I could go into more detail but I‚Äôll save everyone the length of it. For now we‚Äôve just decided that unfortunately we don‚Äôt have the family we thought. I certainly don‚Äôt have a father and it‚Äôs only now I realize I never did. I can‚Äôt express how heartbreaking it is to watch one father abandon me at 12 and another be disgusting to me as an adult. \n",

      "\n",
      " I (33f) went to visit my home state and family for a job opportunity in dispatching requiring I test. I left my husband (36m) behind as he had to work but took my kids (3f & 7m). The trip was a Wednesday-Sunday over the holiday weekend. My father (61m) is my stepdad and has been married to my mom (53f) for 25 years, they also have my sister whose 16. I also have an older sister (38f) and her husband and 4 kids who were visiting with everyone while we were there. \n",
      "We had a great trip overall, the kids and I road-tripped for the visit, stayed in my parents house, and thoroughly enjoyed lots of food and fun outside of my 3 hr test. \n",
      "Everything was great until Saturday night. My parents home is in the country on about 3 acres of land, they have a fire pit we all love in the backyard so the adults sat out drinking quite a bit while the kids crashed this night. Everyone was quite drunk except for me and my older sister. My father and I ended up being the last adults left outside and began chatting. He had seemed off the entire visit like he was just unhappy so I asked why (we‚Äôve always been able to talk about anything and he has helped me many times overcome issues in my life). He dumped out so much about how miserable he was in his marriage and how they never are intimate anymore. We chatted in length about the issues he felt in their marriage, and I shared with him some of the struggles I‚Äôve had in mine over the decade we‚Äôve been together. He then confessed he envied my marriage as he has watched my husband and I work through some things that would break many marriages (his words) and that he wants that but can‚Äôt have it. (I found this shocking bc my family doesn‚Äôt like my husband at all.) He (stepdad) is extremely unwilling to change himself in any manner which my mother has begged him to do, so it is more of he wants but won‚Äôt work for it just to be clear. He then began a rant about sex, (this is when I started seeing alarms) what he likes and doesn‚Äôt, what my mother won‚Äôt do anymore, how emasculated he feels bc she won‚Äôt have sex with him, and much more in great detail, then pivoted out of nowhere asking me if he did these things to me right now would it turn me on enough to sleep with him bc after all we aren‚Äôt even related so I wouldn‚Äôt have to feel guilty. He spoke so fast and so aggressively I couldn‚Äôt even get a word in I just froze in shock. \n",
      "I got up and just said I‚Äôm going to bed goodnight, I needed to get away I didn‚Äôt know what also to do. All the alarm bells were screaming in my head he then walks in right behind and begs me to touch my body to which I said no go to bed. He leaves me then come back and says I‚Äôll leave you alone but I need you to know how sexy you are just like your mom. I was horrified. \n",
      "This man is the only father I have ever known! My bio dad abandoned me when my mom got remarried (I was young). He has been very present in my life and has been someone whose always there for me. I‚Äôve always known him as a conservative religious man. \n",
      "\n",
      "To add insult to injury here, when my husband and I were married at about the 4 year mark, my husband stopped by my parents home when my dad wasn‚Äôt home and my mom was home alone to drop something off to her she has asked him for so she knew he was coming to the house. My dad called my husband and accused him of trying to see his wife naked or sleep with her etc. it was a huge confrontation he threatened my husband and everything. He has accused my husband of that anytime he‚Äôs been around my mom without him present even at family things when my bil is present too. \n",
      "\n",
      "No one in my family but my husband know that this has happened yet. I am terrified to say anything! I want to put him for this bc he has ruined everything for me and I can not even function right now bc of the disgust and shame I feel for what he did. My husband is livid with my step dad, and worried about my mental state now as this incident has triggered a lot of stress and old issues from my past with horrible men (that‚Äôs a story for another post). \n",
      "\n",
      "Would I be the asshole for blowing this up and outing my stepdad to my family? Or should I just ignore it and keep it to myself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: when my mom asked my husband to go to the house my stepdad was the one that was home that my husband interacted with that day. I misunderstood and always thought my stepdad got angry bc he wasn‚Äôt home. My mom was never there he was just angry for no reason I guess. He‚Äôs maintained this problem for years now.\n",

      "I (26F) moved from California to Oklahoma in January of 2023 after living in LA for the past 25 years. I moved to be able to live with my boyfriend and leaving all my family and friends behind makes me miss them so much. Because of this, I am planning a trip next year with my bf for two weeks in June to visit my family. For one of those days, I planned to dedicate a whole day at Disneyland with my closest friends, whom I all met in high school. In total, it would be my boyfriend (I can‚Äôt leave him at my parent's house bored all alone lol, also he‚Äôs never been to Disneyland) and I, plus the four friends from high school. I was happy because this would make it so it would be even for all the rides. \n",
      "\n",
      "About six months ago when I made the plan, I specifically told everyone that it would be only the six of us and everyone agreed to it. However, one of my friends, ‚ÄúMike‚Äù (28M) recently told me he would not be comfortable going with everyone even though he knows most of the people in the group (we all went to high school together and graduated the same year) except my bf. I know Mike isn‚Äôt close to all of them, the majority of everyone isn‚Äôt with each other but they‚Äôve all talked in high school at least once or twice because of me. He‚Äôs worried he won‚Äôt get along with everyone, but I can say that all my friends that are going and my bf are generally nice people (I don‚Äôt like being friends with rude or mean people) but he is still insisting on inviting a plus one. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up saying no because it was supposed to be a reunion with all my close friends from high school.  Mike got upset and told me that I‚Äôm messed up for not attending to his needs (he has always had social anxiety since high school and told me he‚Äôs always had bad experiences in groups and feels left out because he is gay/generally always having negative feelings towards people who he is not close with). I told him that I would make sure he doesn‚Äôt feel left out but I would not be able to exclusively give him all my attention the entire time at Disneyland (which he expected me to). Besides, I want everyone to have a good time and I was planning on everyone to be taking turns with each other on rides together, so no one feels excluded. \n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that this experience might be awkward for people but this will make it so everyone can get to know each other better. Also, I made it clear that there was going to be absolutely no cliques because that would suck. I also told Mike that I knew for a fact none of my friends nor my boyfriend are homophobic, and everyone knows that he recently came out a few years ago since he posted it on his Instagram (he has most of the group as mutual). Despite this, he insisted that he would only feel comfortable if he had a ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù specifically that he knows well enough to get on the rides with him and that would accept him (he has fears that people in the group will out him for his personality.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike kept explaining that it wasn‚Äôt guaranteed that he would get along with anyone in the group and that he would feel left out the entire time and wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell me since he didn‚Äôt want to ruin my experience that day. However, I told him in a positive way that he might end up getting along with everyone. He immediately disagreed so I told him that his bringing a plus one would make the rides uneven, and someone would always have to be sitting by themselves. Mike said this could be fixed if someone else brought a plus one, which I had to disagree with. \n",
      "\n",
      "He then casually tells me that he was talking to his friend ‚ÄúJasmine‚Äù last week about my Disneyland trip and already invited her. He insisted that she would be the perfect friend for him to invite because she loves Disneyland and she goes there multiple times a year, plus he‚Äôs close to her. This made me really upset because he just assumed that I would be okay with it without even asking me first. But I‚Äôm not. I told him again that I did not agree with it because I already made the plans. Mike says that since the trip is not until next year, I could always change my mind. I said that I wasn‚Äôt going to, and he kept saying that since he is spending a good amount of money and his time ‚Äújust for me‚Äù I should accommodate him bringing his friend, so I don‚Äôt ruin his experience/be all for nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am not forcing him to go, I invited him to be a part of my Disneyland trip because I consider him a close friend. However, I don‚Äôt know the person that he wants to invite at all since it‚Äôs his friend from college/work. I specifically wanted a day with all my close friends to celebrate since it‚Äôs going to be more than a year since I have seen them. Mike then asks me why I invited my boyfriend to Disneyland if it‚Äôs just supposed to be a friend's day from high school, but my bf is traveling with me and is also coming from Oklahoma (plus he is paying for the majority -if not all the trip and he‚Äôs never been to Disneyland) so it wouldn‚Äôt make sense not to invite him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mike then decides to tell me how we are ‚Äúadults‚Äù now and I should tell him the truth about him not wanting to bring his friend and implied that I just might be jealous. I am not jealous of his friend whom I have never met at all. He has more friends than I do and tells me all about them whenever we talk about our day-to-day lives. He was in the foster care system even before I met him so that‚Äôs why he prides himself on having so many friends and I‚Äôm happy he has them. Not once have I been jealous. I tell him again that the reason is because I made the plan and this is how I wanted it to go and since I don‚Äôt live there anymore, I wanted to enjoy it the way I envisioned it. \n",
      "\n",
      "He says he doesn‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt let him bring his friend and says that everyone else probably wants to bring a plus one. None of my other friends who were going wanted to invite anyone else since I told everyone that it was going to be my friends-only thing and they respected it. He asked again if I could make an exception for him but then I would have to for everyone, but I already said no plus ones because that was the original plan (my friends only). Mike tells me in a disgusted tone that it‚Äôs alarming that I won‚Äôt allow other people to bring their loved ones/best friends to my Disneyland trip. I proceed to calmly repeat myself multiple times about the reason why but ultimately it goes nowhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "He then asked me how I would feel if I were in his shoes, and he invited me to his only friend's party where his friends ended up being mean to me (I said I expected him to stick up for me like I would if something like that happened to him which would be highly unlikely since no one in my friend group is mean). Mike ignored my response and kept giving me more pessimistic scenarios. I ended up reminding him about the time when he ranted to me a few months ago that he was extremely upset when he invited a co-worker friend to go with him to the Eras Tour but that same friend ended up inviting her best friend (he kept reminding me for weeks after about how betrayed he felt and how he felt he wasn‚Äôt good enough for his friend because she had to invite someone else to go with them) however he told me that it was an entirely different situation (lol).\n",
      "\n",
      " One backstory that I should mention is my friendship with Mike has always been hectic, most of the time I always had to give in to his needs/wants and it‚Äôs draining. It‚Äôs been hard to establish boundaries with him because he always breaks them, and I know it‚Äôs my fault for not holding them up but now I‚Äôm taking accountability and finally putting my foot down. Also, I know he has been going to therapy because he‚Äôs told me that he has manipulative and lying behaviors. Some other friends and my bf have told me to stop being friends with him because of how he acts but we‚Äôve been friends for so long and I still have hope that the therapy will work for him. \n",
      "\n",
      "After our conversation, Mike proceeded to tell me that he would probably not go to the Disneyland trip anyway because of money issues, but I feel like he is making that up. In the end, he still doesn‚Äôt accept my response, but he told me that he would talk to his therapist for a second opinion about my decision because he generally feels like I‚Äôm doing ‚Äúsomething very wrong‚Äù by not accepting him inviting his friend. He said he would let me know if he changes his mind about it but that he would either accept my boundary by coming to the trip by himself or that he wouldn‚Äôt and he simply would not go but at the exact same time implying that this might ruin our friendship of 10 years.

I don't love him doing drugs full stop but he only does it occasionally so I let it slide. A few days after, I mentioned that I wasn't overly happy about it and he got quite defensive and made me feel like the a-hole. I don't want to stop him being friends with other females, but I do feel like there should be SOME boundaries. AITAH?\n",

Last month, her mom had a stroke unexpectedly and she became responsible for taking care of her after she was released from the hospital. When she told me, I said I was sorry, sent my love, and offered to be of help. At the time, I was staying with friends for the week out of town. We spoke once over the phone, and texted a bit, but didn‚Äôt talk much.

She got really upset, and said that my comment made it seem like I prioritized my friends over her. I said that was not true and not fair‚Äî I was in touch but just didn‚Äôt give as much as she wanted. I said I understood she was hurt, but that i wasn't at fault and wasn‚Äôt an appropriate target for her anger. She then told me it's important that she can trust me to support her in an emergency. I said that if she didn't trust me, then that was a huge issue and I told her i didn't want tot talk about this if she was going to be angry with me. I ended the conversation after that because it felt like it was getting out of hand.

Everything was fine until one day in Sep 2021 he was elected the President of his Hall (Hostel) of Residence (tenure of 1 year)- which gives you certain political power within the campus. You are then a member of the Institute Senate and can take all decisions concerning your hostel and the wellbeing of its boarders.\n",

He started showing off in our daily convos about how he is such an important person in the campus, how so many people know him and come to him for help etc. Even though it was off-putting to hear him constantly brag about this, I was okay with it and didn't say anything as I wanted to give him the space to feel good about himself.

He ignored my texts and calls for hours, and would call after long just to say- hey, sorry, was busy with elections. I would still hopefully ask- can we meet/talk now? and he would say no again. He would cancel our long-planned meetups often. I would wait for him for 10 hours for a plan he had promised to long back, but on the day he would forget about it or be super late. Even after all of this, I still decided to keep it aside cause I loved him unconditionally. But then came the absolute worst thing. He would refuse to stand beside me during his hall's sports matches, stating- It would be weird for people to see that a HP is standing with his girlfriend during his hall's match. They would think he is more interested in spending time with his girlfriend instead of focusing on his hall. He is LITERALLY on the ground watching the match right before his eyes, what more does he need to do? Just standing beside me while watching the match would cause his image harm? He started telling me not to come to watch his hall's sports matches as it would not be possible for him to 'entertain' me during the match, while all I am asking for is to just be present beside him quietly.

After being treated like shit by my boyfriend, especially in those last 2 months, one day, the other guy, let's call him D, and I were just walking, talking and strolling around. A moment got built, we kissed, and he touched my boobs. Then I stopped. Cause I felt uncomfortable.

This was a great time for us lots of excitement.  Unfortunately we lost that baby and it was the most devastating point in our lives.  I understand that this effects her in ways I could never understand, but that doesn't mean it has no effect on me.  So thinking I'm being a great husband we decided that she should be a stay at home wife and just take care of the house for both her mental and psychical health (I make plenty of money to support us + kids) so she quits her job.  My parents were always excited for us to have kids, and it wasn't uncommon for them to talk about it.  So when this happened, I thought it would be wise to tell them so they don't talk about it with us because of what's going on.  My mother, who also has a long history of miscarriages, tried to be supportive rather then not talk about. This sent the wife into a fury of hatred to my parents.  What makes her more upset, is that I did not share her angry and make a huge spectacle about it.  After this happened in private I had a long discussion with my parents about how I understand they ment well but they cannot do that when we asked them not too.  My wife has never let this go, and she doesn't have to, I understand how this is something that doesn't always heal for everyone.\n",

(I don't want this post to be about pro-life/ pro-choice politics but this part is important to me so please keep that in mind) we had an argument over who we should be voting for during mid-terms and why, her and I always used to see eye-to-eye on these things but that's significantly changed.  During this argument the issue of eptoic pregnancies came up and how women should have the right to get the medical treatment they need for this (which I also agree with which is why this next part of baffling).  While arguing, she said to me, \"I hope it happens to me so you can go through that and see how it feels\".  Absolutely crushed me to hear that.

Once we get past that I want to tell my side of the family, she absolutely does not want that.  She had no problem telling her side though.  I understand she's the one that's pregnant, but it's still my baby too. Naturally this upsets me and I end up telling my family over Thanksgiving when see wanted me to wait till Christmas. (Keep in mind her family already knows).  This causes a fight later at home.  Over the rest of the pregnancy, every single time we went to my parents house there was a fight on the drive home over something a member of my family remotely said involving the baby or politics.

I wasn't even upset she wanted hers there and not mine.  It's the \"friends\" part that upset me, because my wishes should take priority over friends imo. We have an argument about this, not even a bad one, and she ends it by saying \"keep it up and ill tell them not to let you in ether\" absolutely scared the crap out of me.

My wife feeds the baby and my dad makes a joke about how my mother stopped that once we got teeth.  Big mistake.  Shortly after she's done feeding my mother gets a chance to hold the baby.

I can't  go because I dont have the PTO to waste or funds for all that. He has been unaccomodating to my fiances finances and PTO. That doesn't mean we expect him to pay for anything but as an example, my fiance did a different flight that was cheaper and a little further away. His friend didnt like that and said he wouldn't be picking him up if thats the case... its was less than an hour drive and I feel like he could have had another groomsman pick him up or something but he just gets pissy instead. We are trying to save for our own wedding and because of his friends wedding it means we wont be able to go and see family for thanksgiving or go to new york for christmas like we planned.

We want to support him because his fianc√©e and all of his friends have abandoned him and cut off all contact with him. The 9 of us are all he has now.

She told me she  will give me back the money at the end of the day or tommorow. The thing is, it's not the money problem, because we both have money so it's fine, the reason I rejected to give her the cash is because I don't want to be associated with her smoking weed, since I grew up in an alcoholic family and always had some sort of addicts around me. We are both roomates and she smokes weed every single day, 10 times a day, yes, 10 times a day if not more. And she started gaslighing me into giving her the cash, told me that I was being arrogant and that I'm just being principal, because other times I did give her the cash, but today I didn't. I just thought enough is enough, since I don't do any kind of drug and I hate seeing her smoke weed all the time. So why would i give her cash to buy some more even if she gives me the money the day after or just sends the money right now in my credit card. Also, I have an eating disorder.

Recently, we went to a club in London, and I sensed he was unhappy due to the music and his drinking. I wanted to leave, but he insisted we stay.

      "Now, let me tell you about what happened yesterday. We went to this nice club in London, which was my idea. It‚Äôs not the kind of music he likes, but he still came with me, for which I really appreciated it since, being fairly new in the country, we don‚Äôt have many friends yet. This club was a first experience for us in London, and we weren‚Äôt sure what to expect. When we got there, the main club area wasn‚Äôt open yet, but there was a terrace where we could sit and have a drink while waiting. I could sense that he wasn‚Äôt very happy because of the music in this pre-space and mentioned that maybe we could find somewhere with a more ‚Äòvibrant‚Äô vibe in his words.\n",

      "I had two drinks and was completely fine, looking forward to dancing and enjoying the evening. However, he kept drinking one after another (note: he had been drinking even before we arrived). I think the stress of being in a new place, feeling dislocated, and knowing he wasn‚Äôt 100% happy began to affect me, and I started feeling anxious and wanting to leave, which I shared with him. He insisted that we stay since we had paid to be there, and I really wanted to be there, so we stayed for a couple more hours. Eventually, I decided I wanted to leave, with a mix of feelings ‚Äì happy, anxious, and nervous because he was drunk by this point.\n",

      "We left the club, and I was essentially trying to support him as he was clearly drunk. He kept indicating that he wanted to have sex, even suggesting a quickie on the bus back home.

      "About a year ago, I found something that made me feel alive again, while also being good for the family. An old buddy invited me hunting (I'm more of a fisher) and it was just perfect. I rented a cabin with some friends for nearly the entirety of deer season, and had a great time clearing my head out in the wilderness. \n",

      "I did come back for a weekend, for my daughter's 14th birthday. It wasn't anything special, since we were right at the anniversary of her mother's death I figured she was grieving like me and wouldn't want anything big. Got her dinner and some video game she asked about. She seemed fine, and MIL was doing a good job looking after her. She was always very independent, and was handling everything so well, so I decided to plan extended fishing trips as well as for the game seasons during the year, so it'd keep my mind off of things. \n",

      "I guess I got a little overly excited, and I missed the weekend of my daughter's 15th birthday. MIL called me a couple days after and said that she'd caught A crying in private a few times since the date. She suggested coming home for a week and spending time with her. \n",

      "Now I don't think A is that fragile, I saw her cry exactly once since her mother's passing. But I figured I'd at least come home for a day or two, and make it up to her with a gift. I drove home Saturday morning before she was up, and got her a nice gift basket fitting of a growing young lady. I'm glad I didn't stay for longer, she's was still as independent as ever and wanted to just do her own thing. \n",

      "That's fine by me, but MIL seems to think it's a problem. I just think she's growing up to be a young adult, 16 was gonna be the last time we celebrate anyway, no grown adult should care that much about a birthday. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, MIL does see her a more than I do, but what can I even do if she doesn't even want anything for her birthday? I can't force it, and I don't see what the problem is.

He still acted like my bf and cared for me the same but he wouldn‚Äôt let me hold his hand in public or use his water bottle or towel. Things like this made me emotionally detached to him.

      "Lets get background context out of the way first. I(29F) met my husband(44M) when I was 16. I had been in a bad car wreck and ended up in a comatose state for a few days and after I woke up I was in the hospital for a while to recover. He was my doctor at the time and we really hit it off in my 16 year old mind, so when I was discharged I gave him number to stay in contact. I think part of me believed chasing after an older man would somehow be a way to rebel against my parents who were less than great. We began hanging out semi frequently not long after exchanging numbers and one night he offered to buy us alcohol and because I was in the prime of my dumb rebellious teen phase, I accepted. I don‚Äôt remember a lot from that night, just him doing a lot of things I never wanted him to do, even after I told him to stop. A couple weeks after that night I started feeling sick in the morning and missed my cycle more than once and I knew I had to take a pregnancy test, which unsurprisingly was positive. My parents are extremely religious and conservative so they insisted I not only not get an abortion but instead get married so I didn‚Äôt live in sin. To my surprise, my husband was more than happy to get married, even though his parents believed I baby trapped him because he comes from old money. The wedding happened before I really started showing, and a few months later I had a baby boy. I was honestly miserable until he was born, and to this day he‚Äôs still the light of my life. We had two more kids. A daughter, and we adopted a somewhat distant relative on my husband‚Äôs side‚Äôs son.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jump forward to now, my kids are 12, 9, and 5, and my husband no longer works at the hospital we met at and instead works at a private clinic his family owns. While my kids were upstairs playing, I was cleaning my husband‚Äôs home office when I accidentally turned his computer on when I moved the mouse dusting his desk. I was greeted with an open Instagram dm of him talking to another woman and my heart shattered reading the things he said to her. But I wasn‚Äôt truly appalled until I clicked on her profile and learned she was 15. I felt sick, and when I clicked on his dms to see them again, I realized she wasn‚Äôt the only underaged girl he talked to, some of their messages even implying they had met up before. I know I should have taken pictures, screenshots, anything for proof, but I just stood there shocked and feeling empty. My eldest son came into the room, and I quickly shut the computer off so he couldn‚Äôt see what I was looking at. He asked if I was making dinner soon, and I think I just snapped back into some autopilot mom mode so I didn‚Äôt freak him out. I told him I‚Äôd start working on it and he told me he and his siblings wanted to watch some show in the living room, so they moved downstairs next to the kitchen. \n",
      "\n",
      "I started making dinner and told myself I‚Äôd investigate further when my kids were asleep. They were and always will be my top priority. But I couldn‚Äôt help thinking about those messages the entire time I was cooking. They kept replaying in my mind over and over again, tormenting me and driving me insane. That‚Äôs when my husband came home. Even though it‚Äôs common for him to come home when I‚Äôm cooking dinner, it still chilled me to my core to see him walk through the door. I couldn‚Äôt stand to face him, so I stood with my back to him as I was cutting the chicken. He came up behind me and put his arms around me to greet me. He said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been missing you all day‚Äù and just hearing him say the same kind of things to me as he‚Äôd say to those girls made something inside of me break. I gripped the knife I was using to cook and spun around on him, slashing his arm in the process. I don‚Äôt know in that moment if I wanted to hurt him or if I just wanted him to get away from me. He had this confused angry look on his face, and for some reason his anger just set me off more. Like he didn‚Äôt believe he deserved this for what he did to those girls, and I think a repressed part of me wanted to punish him for what he did to me too. I spent my whole married life trying to justify how I wasn‚Äôt a victim, but all that training I did to myself was being undone. I went at him a few more times with the knife, but the damage was minimal, mostly because he‚Äôs around 6‚Äô2 and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3. Once the shock died down, he apprehended me pretty easily, trying to calm me down. I was inconsolable, calling him every name under the sun, until he pointed out I was scaring our kids. I hadn‚Äôt realized they were standing in the doorway of the kitchen, and the looks on their faces broke my heart in a brand new way. They looked so afraid of me. Everything I had just done hit me in the chest hard, and I yanked away from my husband and run upstairs, locking myself in a bathroom. I began to cry and I just couldn‚Äôt stop.

He has proof via our children witnessing the attack but I don‚Äôt have any proof and I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs even met up with any of them and did real harm to them. What hurts the most now is not knowing what my kids think of me anymore. I want to justify myself, tell them everything, but I don‚Äôt think my younger two will understand, and I‚Äôm afraid even if all three do understand, that I‚Äôll be ruining their lives and their chances at a bright future. If they grow up hating their father, they‚Äôll never have the support they need from his family for schooling for anything like that, and since I essentially went NC with my family, I have no support group nor do I have money saved or a job.

It turns out he told Kassidy I am trying to force things and that we are strangers and he has zero interest in me. He was \"being nice.\" I thought that we had shared a genuine connection in the course of this one day and that I made him realize his interest in relationships despite him claiming he does not want one. Why is it so hard for him to be there for me emotionally????? It is basic human decency. Now Kassidy is telling me to stop texting her about it already and everyone keeps asking how my boyfriend is. He's fine and everything's perfect I just want one more. Kassidy met Hector 7 years ago and dated him when they were 14.

With the current political climate I was surprised when they decided to \"accept\" me anyway. To their credit they've done a good job gendering me correctly.

Then, my dad told me that one of his coworkers saw T flirting with another woman. I calmly asked T what my dad was talking about, and I had a good reason to believe he wouldn‚Äôt lie to me, because ever since I‚Äôd met him he‚Äôd always say exactly what‚Äôs on his mind.

      "I (22m) have been in a relationship with my gf(22f) for more than four years but we were basically in ldrs for 2/3 of our relationship because of education and other reasons. I told my gf from the start that I value trust more than anything in a relationship so if she want to know sth from me, she just need to ask me. And I would do the same to her. At first she seemed to agree to it but after some time passed, it was obvious that she don‚Äôt fully trust me in anything. So I asked her about it and turns out she has trust issues due to her previous relationships. When I learned about it, the only thought that came to my mind was that I will be different and I will be better. I will treat her with respect and trust so that she could trust me 100% and I did exactly that. I told her everything about where I was going, what I was doing. If I was doing sth without her,I always let her know what I was doing. But time and time again, whenever I did sth without her like going out with my friends, male or female, she would get upset and we would always argue about it. Whenever sth like that happened, to me it just seems like she don‚Äôt trust me but every time she said that she does trust me but it was just jealousy or some other reasons like that. And every time I would forgave her but arguments like that happened multiple times throughout our relationship. But every time I forgave her hoping she would trust me more. And I know I am not perfect. Sometimes I made her upset because of me being stupid and selfish and I always tried to be better and not do the same mistakes but I never did anything behind her back without letting her know nor I did sth she doesn‚Äôt like. But no matter what I do, she just can‚Äôt seem to trust me completely. However, the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back just happened. A few weeks ago, we met up and she stayed in my apartment for a week just hanging out and it was such a great time and I was so happy about it to this day but she just confessed to me that she went through my phone while I was sleeping because she doesn‚Äôt trust one of my female friends. When I heard about that, I realized she never trusted me nor ever will. She is still  saying that she trust me she just don‚Äôt trust my friend but if she wanted to see my chat, I would have shown her without hesitation because I have nothing to hide. I should have realized that earlier because she asked me about that friend while we are staying together and I answered she was just a friend it was just about studies and shits because it‚Äôs true.  Most of the conversations between me and that friend was just asking each other about the studies and topics for exam, what is the classroom no and shit like that. She could have just asked but she instead chose to violate my privacy and my trust in her and now i feel like everything I have been building up in this relationship has crumbled and I can‚Äôt see returning from this. She apologized to me profusely saying that it won‚Äôt happen again like she always does but I just can‚Äôt accept this anymore. On one hand, I still want to forgive her after all of this but on the other hand,I don‚Äôt think trust can be rebuilt once it crumbles. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Or AIJTAH for being angry in the first place.\n",

He got really upset and he said he couldn't handle me meeting up other people in my appartment and that he doesn't approve me trying to move on because he doesn't like the people I meet up with. I know for him and her the only place they could go to to have some privacy is her trailer, because she's married with two kids and she and her husband live in a house together, so that place wouldn't be an option for them.\n",

She wants to call it hers, I want to call it ours because we'll both be putting time and effort into it. I'm working to be a mechanic so I can do all the maintenance myself to save us some money . She doesnt plan on driving the car much as we live in the city and she doesng like driving in the city, so i would mostly be driving it. And it would just spend most of the summer parked and ofc in storage in the winter. the car in question has 206,000km, its been sitting for at least a year needs a new power steering hose and who knows what else, the interior is all destroyed. She wants to restore it to its original look which I'm down for but since it's very expensive to get original parts if I even can,    I would like to modernize the inside a bit like bluetooth and speakers as well as a digital speedometer things like that but keep the overall feel as original as possible, but she has a different vision\n",

      "Am I the asshole for taking a break from my relationship? I 18 f and my 23 m boyfriend have know each other for 13 years and dating for 8 months. Growing up we were close, grew up in the same neighborhood and had siblings around the same age. At the start of the relationship everything was good, we had good conversations and the chemistry was there. The only red flag was that he was extremely spiritual, which doesn‚Äôt sound all that bad. But it was to the point that he was acting god like. Him and I both grew up being the black sheep of our own family and we both have been locked up at one point or another. This of course didn‚Äôt matter to me because it was situationally expectable. I love him to death and I would do anything for him. Three months into the relationship he went homeless, so I dropped everything and stayed in a tent with him. ( I couldn‚Äôt let him stay with me because I was in a situationship).  During this time he picked up a raging drug habit. (Crack and meth. That I know of.) I understand that too because I‚Äôve had my own issues with drugs. But it got to the point that he would leave me in the tent for hours in the dark around other people that were also on drugs.  He also knew that I was the only female in the tents area. I took care of him paying for him to eat and kept him accountable for himself and his personal hygiene. We had gotten into arguments about his drug habits to the point where I would leave and he would threaten to commit suicide and make actions to do it. But when I would come back he would end up doing the exact same thing. Then I found money missing out of my wallet. (during this time I had a job).  So of course I confronted him about this to which he said that someone robbed the tent. Which couldn‚Äôt have happened because there was a lock on the tent and nothing else in the tent was missing and my debit and savings card was still there. This started a huge argument and at the height of this argument we started fist fighting and I‚Äôm not one to shy away from a fight and I can hold my own. Then I was like yk what fuck it I don‚Äôt need to be here anymore and tried to get my stuff out of the tent so that I could go. Which caused him to pull out the large hunting knife that he kept in the tent as a backup in case anyone there caused problems. He started throwing all of my stuff out of the tent and said that if I got any closer to him he would stab me so I egged him in saying that he had no balls and he wouldn‚Äôt. So he continued to buck the knife in my face saying he wanted me dead. Then I started to walk away. When I was walking away, the only thing  he could scream was that if I left he would kill himself. But at that point I really didn‚Äôt care because this dude almost killed me or at least threatened to. But I ended up taking him back because he hadn‚Äôt gotten sleep for a couple of days off of meth. The weeks that followed them were not all that bad and he had good behavior. It was winter months and where we are it gets really really cold. I decided that it wasn‚Äôt safe to be outside in this weather, so I got us a hotel room. A week in to our hotel stay i drank in my medicine it was around new years, and I wanted to be relaxed so I took a couple of shots and hung out before I went to sleep. I don‚Äôt end up waking up until 1pm the next day and it was Good for me to get some rest. But this seemed to set him off. That whole day he wouldn‚Äôt stop calling me selfish and only thinking about myself. So I promised him that the next day I would wake up early so we could do what he wanted to do. And that‚Äôs what I did I woke up early the next day. And everything was all good until we got back to the hotel. To which he blew up at me again calling me selfish and went even farther to say that I didn‚Äôt deserve love. He grabbed the knife that he had from the tent and said that if I didn‚Äôt give him all the money in my wallet he was going to murder me. And I quote ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not going to make it out alive, I want you gone dead, and this is probably going to make the news‚Äù. At this point I start crying like I‚Äôve taken care of this man and I‚Äôve literally thrown my life away so you wouldn‚Äôt have to go through this alone. That day he held me at knife point for over an hour. But I stayed because he said he would kill me if I tried to leave. Things calmed down after that point. I kept the knife with me after that point so that he couldn‚Äôt use it against me. Until he went to the gas station and saw someone he had problems with to which he came back got the hotel Room  and back me into the bathroom screaming inches from\n",
      "My face saying that if I didn‚Äôt give him the knife he would beat the shit out of me. At this point I had, had enough and I  just wanted to kill myself so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with this anymore. The next day I left I packed up all of my stuff. And went to stay with a friend out of state. He called me hours later and asked if we were over and I didn‚Äôt have the heart to break up with him. And just said we were on a break. And he said I was selfish for leaving him in the tents all by himself. Am I the asshole\n",

We were all on a FaceTime, and my sister hung up because she had to go help my mother with something. (For context as to why I didn‚Äôt hang up as well, we don‚Äôt live in the same house.) We were talking and I was being friendly, he started flirting and I was humoring him/flirting back, but then he told me he was horny, and started asking me to show him stuff even after I said no. I got very uncomfortable/scared and told him I was leaving the FaceTime, and texted my sister telling her what happened. My sister told me that I led him on, and he seems to think I led him on as well, and I feel really bad about it. I did like him, but I‚Äôm really uncomfortable with anything like that.

She always use my deadname and then apologize saying she just \"isnt used to it yet\" (its been more than a year since I came out as trans).

She continued to say that she would miss the dick too much. I then asked what about trans women? She again made a face. I was shocked as she tried to explain with bullshit excuses why she couldnt date a guy with a vag or a girl with a dick. I finally told her she was being transphobic and she got defensive saying not wanting to date trans people was just a preference like not wanting to date a brunette. She even said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault every trans person I've ever seen is ugly‚Äù. Um excuse me? I continued to argue that she was being an asshole and she said that she could maybe kiss one at a party if she didn‚Äôt know but it bothered her when the person ‚Äúlooked trans‚Äù. At that point all I wanted to do was to leave, but our food came and I ate while she rambled about her stupid love life again. I left as soon as I could. When I came home, I text her and told that what she said that night was extremely transphobic and that I loved her, but she would have to learn if she wanted to continue being part of my life. She defended herself saying she needs time and nobody is born knowing how to deal with everything.\n",

I also know for a fact that she just said all of those things because she trusts me and we have always been a safe space to each other where we could talk about anything without feeling judged.

For a while I was thinking about marrying her especially after my son was born. When he was born I thought it was about time to put the ring on the finger. But one thing was stopping me. And that one thing was my fianc√©s stubborn and aggravating mother. Ever since day one she has been my worst enemy. I soon knew she hated me when I overheard her talking to my fianc√© about breaking up with me in the past. After that I soon knew she was out to get me. She would often try to accuse me of cheating with the only proof being that I was good friends with my female co-workers. Of course no one believed her. She was over 50 and was stubborn like other old women that lived. I didn‚Äôt really care about her hatred towards me and no one else did either me and my wife were happy and that was all. And she also took her anger out on my son. My fianc√©‚Äôs siblings each had children of their own and even then she treated them better than her own grandson. Just like Christmas. She bought each of my in-laws children about 3 gifts each, while she only gave my son 1 and that was a stuffed bear. Every single year. While the other children got things like a new stroller, bouncers, and new clothes. While she gave my some a half torn stuffy, sometimes passed down from her children themselves. I didn‚Äôt like what she was doing and informed my fianc√© on it. And all she had to was that she would get over it soon but she never did of course.\n",

Y'all have an incredibly hard, underpaid often thankless job and I'm sorry I added to the problem even if it was just one phone call. The teachers that embarrassed her didn't mean to, they just chose a bad time, they did their outline, then told the class to work independently- so picture a quiet classroom working independently then one kid gets called to the front to whisper with the teacher?

He's not seen her since she was 6 weeks old when I left as I realized I could only take care of one child, not two.  A few years later he signed away his parental rights so he wouldn't have to pay child support ( I never got a dime, not that I wanted it) we have a great relationship with his mom and sister.  My daughter has reached out to ask for a FaceTime call, nothing more, out of curiosity I think to just see and hear him other than old pics and the wedding DVD I have.  He never followed through.\n",

      "Fifth: ADD diagnosis- I know it's not a bad thing, lots of people have it.  It came to a head with COVID and zoom school, so she was 11 almost 12 when diagnosed.  I felt so bad that I'd just always thought she was a \"dreamer\" with her \"head in the clouds\" and that's a rough time, puberty, for a kid, so much else is changing in your body then suddenly you find out your brain needs a pill? Every day for the rest of your life?  I felt bad for not helping her and seeing the signs sooner, not so much about the pill- whom of us adults don't take something for cholesterol, heartburn, depression etc. on the daily but as a kid she struggled with it. And, it's her news to tell to whom she wants when she wants, that's okay. She hates that she even has a 504 so I'm honest with her about what those meetings entail. She's still coming to grips with it, so I try to be as supportive as I can and reinforce that it's not a bad thing. IDK man, being a teenager is hard.\n",

      "Lastly, Karen: My favorite aunt is named Karen and she's a lovely person.  Whilst yes, I am a 45yo white woman with blonde hair I try to use my inner Karen powers for good and not evil. My daughter and friends love to have sleepovers at my house and do activities with me- I took them to FNAF and last minute was their Freddy, my daughter loves cosplay, has a decent following on TikTok, and I've taken her to cons and let her dress me up, I had a Halloween party last week with 5 teens, I've taken several of her friends camping that have never been outside the city, our house is always open, I could go on but likely the internet will think I'm protesting too much.  I filled in for the Cheer coach at a fundraiser for an NCAA football game and that day I was a Karen because of all the tipsy middle aged men hitting on 16 year olds. So I'll admit I was a bad Karen during this phone call. I'm going to volunteer in French class on Monday and I'll go early to check in and apologize in person.  I don't deserve a weak ass phone apology I'll say it face to face and take my lumps.\n",

      "Hi Reddit, so I am 45f with one kid 15f, it's just been me and her since I divorced her dad.  She had an appointment last week- just a regular checkup and med check as she has ADD.  Maybe I was projecting because she's a little sensitive about it and it took her a couple of years to make peace with the fact that she has to take a pill everyday- thinking that she was \"broken\" or \"why doesn't my brain work right\"\n",

      "Anyway, last Friday she has an appointment, we go all is good, prescription refilled, grab some Subway and I drop her off at lunchtime.  On the way home I call the school to excuse her absence, saying she had an appointment blah blah blah.  For context despite the ADD she tries really hard in school and has all A's and B's this semester, yay!\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to that afternoon, I'm working and the school calls me asking if it was a medical appointment, I ask why that's pertinent, she says they need to check a certain box if it's medical or personal.  I ask if this is about COVID? No, she says, they just need to annotate what type of appointment.  I say I'm pretty sure that's a HIPAA violation (wait is it two Ps or two As? I can never remember) she says it's for their records.  I admittedly was not very nice and said that that was unnecessary, invasive and for future reference whenever my daughter is absent  mark it as a personal appointment, that this is ridiculous and none of their business. I wanted to say a lot more but just hung up on her after that.\n",

I feel badly because it was likely a low level admin just trying to do their job, but honestly, given the healthcare situation especially with women now, I felt it was overstepping why would they need to know? I don't want to make my daughter's life hard at school, but don't want to be \"that mom\" either. AITA? Any other parents experienced this?\n",

Perhaps I was a little sensitive as my daughter has a 504 plan so I already have to meet with teachers and admin every year and share her details.  She doesn't take advantage of the accommodations, we've worked thru those with me helping her with homework but it's nice to know they're there if needed. Twice this year teachers have called her out on said accommodations and embarrassed her in class, something that she‚Äôs already self conscious of, and is nobody‚Äôs business. We don‚Äôt think the teachers we malicious but still it was tough. I was TA in this situation, simply because I was rude to someone who was just trying to do their job and I get that, hence this post, I was feeling guilty and also curious because I feel like this is a new thing?  When she's sick they have the whole  COVID schpeel and I'll say oh she has the flu but we've rapid tested it's not covid or whatever, I'm fine with that.

I had five teens at my house for Halloween, on a Tuesday. Look thru my past profile jeesh, I try my best.  I provide them home cooked meals and some fun. I am the parent that takes my daughter and her friends to events and I feel like if a large group of 15/16yo want to regularly be seen with me in public, I'm doing ok. I took three of them to the FNAF movie and the fourth got grounded so guess who dressed up with them and was their Freddy Fazbear at the last minute and was their paparazzi and even did a TikTok with them?

      "He said he thought I was a virgin and said it was unnatural and worst of all said if we hadn‚Äôt gotten together, I would have become ‚Äúa prostitute or something‚Äù.

      "The night after, we Facetimed. He pretty much said the same things, he added that he didn‚Äôt want to break up but if we did then he wanted to have me close as a friend. Once again, I think I was the asshole here because I just laughed at him and told him that wouldn‚Äôt happen.  \n",

However when I went to whatsapp him I see none of my messages are delivered, and his profile pic is gone, meaning he blocked me.

I think it sounds like he has a girlfriend and his friend tells me ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt know‚Äù. This sounds suspicious af to me, because how would you not know if your friend has a girlfriend? But it‚Äôs like whatever and leave it. The other week his friend was in my area hooking up with my friend and they came out with me and the rest of the girls. I ask about if he knows if the guy has a gf or not yet and he just says he‚Äôs still unsure.

      "A little bit of background information; I (15M) do boxing have won 1st in tournaments in Tokyo and Nova Scotia, I recently got a puppy she is just 8 weeks old and very calm/docile. Today my cousin (12M) who has a prosthetic leg got to meet her at a family gathering, he was good with her at first but then said he was going to take the dog and hurt her for fun. I told him not to say things like that and said he's a horrible person, he immediately pulled the physically disabled card and we got into an argument, it ended with him slamming his prosthetic leg onto my dogs stomache area multiple times and I punched him in the face. his parents are both saying I should be kicked out of the family because I hurt her disabled \"baby\" and they want me to pay hospital bills, he was knocked out and lost 2 or 3 teeth.

      "I (M37) have been married to my wife (F32) for 12 years. For some background, we met when she was pretty young (20) and I was a lot more established in my career and life than her at the time. We got married and settled down fairly quickly, and we have three kids together.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to get into the situation, me and my wife have been having a really rough patch for the past seven months or so. It all started with a really intense argument we had one night. It started with her saying she wished she had done more with her life, mainly her career, and how she felt like she had accomplished none of the things she had in mind when she was younger. She said, compared to me, she felt like she hadn‚Äôt accomplished much in her career (I earn a lot more than her and am a relatively high earner in my field). I tried to comfort her by saying that she should be proud that she‚Äôs raised three beautiful children and created a life with me. I told her she didn‚Äôt need to be a high earner or really advanced in her career to be successful in my eyes. She seemed to get annoyed by this and then started to blame me, saying I forced her to be someone she‚Äôs not by ‚Äúforcing‚Äù her into being more domestic and into having kids really early on in our marriage at a time when she wanted to focus on her career. To be honest, I was very upset because from my recollection, we‚Äôve always made decisions together, and of course it‚Äôs her body, and she‚Äôs always had a say in what she wants to do with it. I snapped back at her and told her it was her decision as much as it was mine, and she should stop acting like our children are a burden to her and like I haven‚Äôt had to raise them too. I told her she was just blaming me for her problems because she couldn‚Äôt handle the fact she just didn‚Äôt have as much ambition and as much of a work ethic as me. I said that I worked hard for where I was at in my career, and she needs to grow up and realize things won‚Äôt always go her way. She got very upset, and started crying. I tried to comfort her and make amends, but she didn‚Äôt seem to forgive me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, it‚Äôs been pretty rocky. Our sex life has been pretty much non-existent. We don‚Äôt go on dates, spend as much time together, etc. Honestly, our marriage has always been a little dull and lacking affection since around the second year of our marriage. She was really loving and affectionate before then, especially while we were dating, but she seemed to become colder towards me as the years went on. Still, I love her more than anything, and I tried anything to liven up our marriage during this time. Make dinner for her, buy her flowers, etc. Nothing worked. She stopped cooking less, leaving more of the work at home to me, paying less attention to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up talking to her about it, and she told me she was still upset I never apologized for what I said that night. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt apologize for telling the truth and standing up for myself because I felt she was being unfair. This seemed to make things worse. We basically started living like roommates who have kids together. The only time she would show me any kindness was in front of our kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here is where I make a huge mistake, I can admit that. I reconnected with a female colleague and friend I made from school when I was getting my masters degree, and we started to text. It wasn‚Äôt explicitly romantic at first, but more like an emotional affair. I started texting her about problems with my marriage, and she became a huge source of comfort for me. I‚Äôm sure you can see where this is going, but it becomes romantic, and then sexual (through text). It‚Äôs a long story but I got very close to sleeping with her, but I ended up not going through with it (the farthest we got was a kiss and cuddling).\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife found the messages, and of course she was extremely upset. She blew up at me, screaming that I cheated on her. I told her I didn‚Äôt sleep with her, we just kissed. She said she didn‚Äôt care, and I still cheated on her. She also said she didn‚Äôt really believe me and of course I wouldn‚Äôt admit to her that I slept with another woman. She yelled that she was going to divorce me and try her hardest to take full custody of the kids. She told me to get out, but I ended up staying in the house because I had nowhere to go, and I guess she was too tired to argue with me at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kids don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve done, but she told both my parents. My dad doesn‚Äôt really care (he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any of his business), but my mother is PISSED at me, understandably so. I spoke with her, and although she‚Äôs angry, she still believes we should stay together for the sake of the children which I also believe. My wife hasn‚Äôt started the divorce proceedings or anything, but with how angry she was, I‚Äôm sure she will soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know cheating for people is considered a mortal sin on Reddit, and everywhere pretty much (understandable), but I honestly feel like my wife overreacted. I know I‚Äôm gonna get some hate for this, but I think her divorcing me would be kind of selfish of her and bad for the kids, but I genuinely want to know though, AITA in this situation?\n",

I replied no in an angry tone and shut the door.\n",

      "My father asked who it was and I stated that it was home wrecker, he was initially confused but my sister explain that it's mother girlfriend and my father didn't grow fury as I expected but grew sadness and probably trauma just by seeing her outside the window holding hands with home wrecker.\n",

      "My sister asked my mum why she is here after so many year and she stated that she has been in contact with my uncle and from him, he discovered that me and my sister are both engaged and I'm about to get married and she demanded that she get an invitation, I replied that you abandon your 2 young children for your own needs then you hide in your car and send the home wrecker to try and have a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then started heavy crying, her girlfriend comforted her and my the elder people were pretty disgusted by what they saw and started insulting my mum and home wrecker stated that she let her own ambitions overwhelm herself but she isn't at fault as my father refused to let her contact us while she was in America, I told her that father made a good choice not to let you contact us and then my dad threatened to call the police if home wrecker and mother don't leave and they left yelling that our whole family is homophobic.\n",

Though, where I may be the AH was that I found out after a month or so of knowing him thar he was Kate‚Äôs ex (another co-worker mentioned it to me). I did not tell Kate that I was talking to her ex, and I also did not tell her husband that I was friends with Kate (possibly another AH move, because according to the same co-worker, Charles doesn‚Äôt like to associate with anyone who knows Kate‚Ä¶ she has apparently sent people in the past to \n",

      "Hello Reddit, my husband and I have been estranged from the MIL for a little over a year now. I have thankfully been given advice in the past that has allowed us to move forward with the MIL and things have gotten better....mostly. Up until this point we only cut off the MIL while having the father under limited contact.  \n",
      "The change:  \n",
      "This changed after my husband's great-grandmother died. The son was offered to buy the house, unbeknownst to us until a few days ago that we were in the will. The will stated that the great-grandmother, we'll call her Sue, (there's a lot of people is why) had a list of people whom had first pick to buying the property at a substantial discount. Her children (all of whom had equal rights to each other, if nobody wanted it, her grandkids, followed by married great-grandchildren. The only set there was is my husband and I, whom had been looking for a house before her passing near family. The father was told we had \"dibs\" but not that we were in the will as the next people to get to decide, which we would have said yes to. In short, my husband and I estranged from him, my spouse is now seeking legal council from my aunt and we are moving away from his family, no longer caring to be anywhere near them due to long term emotional and mental abuse as well as familial alienation.  \n",
      "Thankfully any previous abuse over the course of 7 years, with the last 3, was well documented with emails, texts, recordings, witness statements, and professional therapist assistance in regards to the mental toll that has worsened over the years on my husband from pinpointed abuse caused by what they defined as a narcissistic relationship towards the scapegoat child. This allowed us to get the first cease and desist against the mom, but we were unable to get one against the father, as the court deemed him, at worst, negligble. We now see he as an enabler.  \n",
      "My aunt feels there is a case like the last instance, however, this time there may be an ability to fight for financial compensation. However, at the end of the day, we just want the calls and harassment to stop, feeling his immediate family has nothing positive to contribute to our lives (emotionally or mentally). We are now seeing the rest of his family in the process enable the behavior by asking us to come back and instead, my husband is digging his heels in more, saying that they shouldn't encourage an abusive relationship to continue and some are calling me to ask him to stop, yet all I was able to say was \"You can speak to our attorney.\"  \n",

That it was a deal breaker for me not to be able to have children. I constantly suggested we both go get tested but he didn't really care about kids at the time so told me not to bother going.

      "\n",
      "I have tried to respond to as many comments as I can but am going to have to stop now because it's getting a bit much. I just wanted to clarify a few points that keep popping up in the comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "1- The comments seem to be mostly that I am TA. Fair, I accept I was the AH in that situation but I really didn't appreciate the vulgar comments. I came to talk and people seem so ready to attack instead of just give an opinion (AH or not). To some of you.. I hope you get the help you need if you feel like being hateful to a random person online makes you feel better about yourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "2- I absolutely in no way \"forced\" him to do that test. He had every right to say no. I asked multiple times over the 2 years (including trying to talk about it... multiple times) and he always brushed me off.. until he didn't. I also complained understand now after talking to him why he brushed it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "3- My husband absolutely understands why I asked him. Just like I absolutely understand why he feels hurt. I have already apologized and we have talked about it like adults. He harbours 0% resentment towards me and does not think I'm a \"disgusting person\" üòÉ\n",
      "\n",
      "4- For everyone who suggested counselling.. we did the healthy thing for our marriage and started counselling early on because we believe all relationships have issues and we wanted to tackle everything head on from the start and learn how to communicate in a healthy way. This is just something he never mentioned before.\n",
      "\n",
      "5- I am absolutely grateful for everyone who took the time to comment, whether in a constructive way (both AH and NTA) and those who were trying to be hurtful and less constructive. Because it reminded me that we are all people going through our own thing. I am not hurt by these comments because I try to be a better person every day and do the best I can for my family. I wish you all love in your lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "6- We are not defined by mistakes that we make. For people insulting me.. come on grow up. You have every right to your opinion but calling me disgusting and vulgar and surprised that he would marry me? Someone even suggested that he should have hit me. That one made us both giggle a little because of how unhelpful it was. üòÑ\n",
      "\n",
      "7- My husband and I come from VERY different cultures. In mine (as I mentioned in one of the comments) we do not have children before marriage (absolutely no judgement to those who do) and we do not get divorced except for infidelityand infertility. That's why I told him we should BOTH get tested and it absolutely would have been 100 percent fair if he had ended the relationship after finding out I couldn't have children and he wanted them. Because we would have wanted different things. \n",
      "\n",
      "8- My husband did not have cancer. He underwent chemo because his appendix had ruptured and as a result of that they had to surgically clean inside around that area (sorry I don't what that is in English). He had some growth and they decided to shrink it with chemo instead of attempt to remove it surgically for a couple of reasons. And no he did not consider storing his sperm at the time. This was years before we met.\n",
      "\n",
      "9- Finally.. a lot of people \"suggested\" that there were \"many\" other ways to have children. I asked him after many people commented (we've been reading a lot of these together) if he would have considered a sperm donor. Firm no from him, and call me backwards but I do not want to carry another man's child. Where we live adoption is pretty hard and could take many many years if ever. It is an emotionally turbulent experience. And IVF is out of the question both financially and emotionally. I watched a very close friend suffer through 11 years of IVF which never took until it did and they had a severely disabled child.. and to say she, her husband and her marriage suffered would be an understatement. It's easy for some people who have never seen this first hand to think they know what they are talking about.\n",

      "\n",
      "She later sent me a picture of her in a dress saying that's what she was going to wear. Now, this dress was very revealing and showed her whole rack except for her nipples basically. It was also very short, putting the entire cake on display. I mean, it's something I'd expect a stripper to wear. I told her to pick another dress and that she could not wear that to the event because there's a certain standard. She said that it's her body and she can wear whatever she wants. I said you either wear something more appropriate or I don't take you. She said cool, don't take me then. \n",

I controlled myself and still explained and politely asked if he could support shifting the department now. He told me that since i was the one having a problem climbing stairs i should handle it myself and not use him as an excuse. I explained that wasn't what i meant but he refused to listen and told me that it was JUST MY PROBLEM and not his.\n",

We watched a football game at  9:30a and then turned the TV off after the game was over. I suggested we put our phones in the other room until our daughters next nap (in about an hour+). I did not say so that we could hang out and focus on the baby but I thought this was implied. He didn‚Äôt seem very into the idea. I told him if he doesn‚Äôt want to do it we don‚Äôt have to, I‚Äôm not trying to twist his arm. He spends some more time on his phone and then agrees. Baby takes a big dump and he asks ‚Äúwill you remember to put the diaper into the ap later?‚Äù (As in when we‚Äôre back on our phones). I say I guess so. This assumes I‚Äôm changing the diaper so I say ‚Äúyou want me to change it?‚Äù And he says yes. Even though I‚Äôve done majority baby care today so he could watch the game. I have to keep her upright for a 10 more minutes before I change it and this is when he closes his eyes on the couch. I go change the diaper. \n",

I feel like I can‚Äôt play with her out here if your napping‚Äù because now I‚Äôm annoyed but also don‚Äôt want to wake him up while I‚Äôm trying to entertain her by reading to her and do tummy time etc. He says I could still play with her while he naps but I say I really feel like I can‚Äôt and please to go to the bedroom.

I call him out on being passive aggressive but he says no, really, he‚Äôs just asking. I tell him I thought we‚Äôd just hang out but now we‚Äôre both pissed and going back and forth. He keeps with the passive aggressive comments and finally I get really pissed and increasingly angry because he keeps being passive aggressive saying he didn‚Äôt know he wasn‚Äôt suppose to nap during that time. I respond why would I want us off our phones for you to sleep? Etc etc. I blow up and tell him our daughter hears when he talks to me like this, that it‚Äôs condescending, that I‚Äôve been straight with him on why I‚Äôm upset and not playing any games.

      "My 7yo nephew has a slew of issues. He still bed wets and up until 2 months ago, he was still pooping his pants (no, it wasn't abuse). He has Encopresis, Bowel Obstruction and ADHD. On top of this, he is a germaphobe. So as you can imagine, it was quite literally an every day struggles and he was always having meltdowns. So he was basically on a bunch of stool softeners for the past 3 years trying to correct the issue and still sleeps in pull ups at night for bed wetting. But 2 months ago he was finally using the bathroom all day long and only continued to have issues at night with bed wetting but never soiling his pants with bowel movements. It was a big step and they were very proud of him. \n",

I was getting really fed up with having to plunge the toilet and the excessive toilet paper he was using and \"shamed\" him. These are the words my SIL used. All I did was tell him that he wasn't allowed to use that much toilet paper and limited his paper usage to 4 squares (plenty) and sternly told him to stop using so much toilet paper. But today, he refused to go to the bathroom at all. He kept shitting in his pants, hiding from me and crying.

Again I just didn‚Äôt say anything and kept quiet. After the dinner, my gf brought it up to make sure I wasn‚Äôt upset. I have never gotten upset at this but she is conscious of it being a little abrasive. I remarked that what he said wasn‚Äôt really true (specifically that a lot of children are getting horomones/surgery, and that it is reasonably rare). She is very not in tuned with politics and basically can only go off what she hears around her, which is usually her family, so she said well that‚Äôs not true it is pretty common, and we then got into a political discussion (which we rarely do) and I remarked that her brother going on the rants is pretty transphobic and de facto pretty homophobic. She is sensitive of her family so she immediately tried to defend them, and winded up eventually saying ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt support BLM does that make me racist?‚Äù To which I remarked ‚Äúyes‚Äù.

      "Okay I (18m) went through my girlfriends (18F) phone without asking. To make things worse this was on her birthday too. Now I have a hard time trusting people. I guess I have a really hard time trusting her because of some people she talks to. For context I was chilling on the couch with her when I saw her open her messages and I saw someone that she used to talk to in her messages. Now I said, \"go back really quick I think I saw something.\" she did but when she showed me it wasn't there. Fastforward 3 hours later her party is starting, and we went outside to greet the friends she invited. I trust those 2 guys with my girlfriend because they don't give off no bad vibes. Later I asked her friend if he wanted me to hold her phone and he gave it to me gladly. Unfortunately, two things happened. First, I went to go take a shit and took her phone with me second, I went through her phone originally to see the photos she took in her outfit. Now I saw a screenshot of someone she used to talk to that texted her something and I was like huh that's funny. So, I took initiative bad move for me and looked through her messages, every other time we had a conversation about this she mentioned that I can go through her phone I just have to ask her. I saw someone she used to talk to still there that I explicitly remember telling her to block I don't know if they dated before or something but when I read the messages between them, I felt sick to my stomach she said she was manipulating someone and that someone I thought was me. There was more that I read but I don't remember, moving on Now why did I feel sick? Well because she is the kind of person to burn things if she breaks up with someone or stops talking to someone. And they stopped talking but she still has the things he got her. Now I remember him asking if she had burned the things and she said no. When I had finished taking a shit, she had come to knock on the bathroom door and realized her friend didn't have her phone. I opened the door said, \"I think it's time for me to go.\" and she said what's wrong. We went in her room I said \" I need you to be honest from the bottom of your heart. Are you manipulating me?\" Understandably she got really upset and said, \"I think it's time you do go home.\" when I heard those words my world shattered because one second were going to talk about it the next not anymore. I know it makes me the asshole for doing this on her birthday, but I need some advice honestly.

My friend isn't playing an important role in the wedding, she's just a guest there. But when she saw these rules she completely flipped on me. She told me that she should be aloud to wear whatever she wants, bring whatever/whoever she wanted, and say whatever; and that telling her she can't is against her constitutional rights! I've told her that this isn't her wedding and that I can set a standard for what is appropriate on at a venue I'M paying for! She apologized and said I was right, and my expectations were reasonable. But, she said she will still bring her own alcohol for herself. I told her that she isn't aloud to and we have been fighting about it whenever we talk.

All of the people in the reception are wearing their colors. Because of her heritage, wearing red to a wedding is completely not ok. Us as guests for alowed to wear literally any clothing we want, as long as it doesn't look trashy and doesn't have those 4 colours as the main color. I understand that alcohol is also a big thing for a lot of people, and not having it at a wedding is usually weird. But most people there are sober anyway or have problems with alcohol. Her and her husband both have alcoholic parents. So now it's very difficult for them to be around people when there's alcohol involved. Every other person said that they would be fine going to this venue and not drinking because they care more about her than they do their own self getting a good buzz.

That kind of stuff. No children that don't know how to behave themselves. Mainly because she loves children, but she doesn't want them to cause messes at her wedding. And as I've previously said, a little bit of the 4 collars that were mentioned are ok. But if your outfit is only those four collars it's not ok. Because the bride and groom are wearing 3 of those colours, and one of them is incredibly disrespectful to wear to a wedding in her culture. Her and her husband are also the only ones paying for this venue. She said she was willing to go dress shopping with anyone who would need to. And the venue was only supposed to be 4 hours tops.\n",

At first I thought it was cute that he liked this show so much,but now it‚Äôs gotten out of hand. I first started to notice how bad it was when he introduced to his friends, and the whole time we were out they just quoted and shouted big bang theory quotes at each other.

He was getting all touchy with me and to be honest i‚Äôm not complaining, he was saying all this stuff to me that I have never heard of him before and what I would never expect him to say. We got to the bedroom and had a GREAT lovemaking session. But this is where it all went downhill, we were both getting to the point where we were about to finish. But when he finally did,I kid you not.This man threw his head back and screamed the word ‚ÄòBAZINGA‚Äô.I stared at him in cold shock and also despair, as he acted as if he didn‚Äôt just say the most least expected thing to say when reaching the climax. \n",

Long story short‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel as if she will ever be comfortable with me or like me.. truth is I feel very awkward around her.. if I was in her position I wouldn‚Äôt like me either, maybe because of the age difference?

I had been dating my boyfriend, let's call him Jack, for a few months now. Jack is a nice guy, but he comes from a less fortunate background than I do. He doesn't have as much money or status as I do, but I liked him because he was kind and funny.\n",

He‚Äôs started growing long eyebrow hairs that make him look like an owl and is happy to leave them be. I feel like we‚Äôre at a stage in our lives (trying to start new careers) where appearances do kind of matter; showing up to a job interview with two weeks of stubble and neck hair maybe isn‚Äôt the best look? He is kind and sweet and would never comment negatively on my appearance, so I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôd be the AH for bringing it up.

      "For some back story I 16m when this happened was dating a girl 16f. I was a sophomore more in hs when this happen and this girl and I had dating for about 3 months it was my first gf and because of this I ignored a lot of red flags. Things like her saying she loved me like a week into out relationship and other little things. Anyways it was about a week before the start of summer break and I knew I was going to be busy during summer so I didn‚Äôt want to be in this relationship and I felt like we had been growing apart. So after school her and I where walking around campus once we got to this spot that was kind of away from everyone else I told her that I didn‚Äôt want to be in the relationship anymore and gave her this whole speech about how I just didn‚Äôt feel ready and a bunch of bs like that she was crying hysterically and I felt really bad so I hugged her and left later that night I get a text saying that if I didn‚Äôt change my mind she was going to tell my parents a bunch of stuff like how I was smoking weed at school and many other worse things then my mom gets a phone call from her dad and he‚Äôs saying that she said I hit her after a hour and a half on the phone it was decided that we would go into the school tomorrow and meet the dean. when I got to the dean‚Äôs office my mom and her dad where waiting and she didn‚Äôt show up to school because of ‚Äúmental distress‚Äù. What she didn‚Äôt know is where I broke up with her at is in perfect sight of a camera and you could clearly see me not hit her. She was a major fuck up and kind of a drama queen but I didn‚Äôt think she was stupid enough to try something like that. Later that night a random number texted me talking about how he was going to kill me and all this bs it turns out she told a ex boyfriend of hers that I r@ped her and he was sending me my address threatening to shoot me with a gun he stole. I showed my parents and they called the police it was now about 1am by the time the police came and took my statement and the message on my phone. Later that night I found out that this guy texting me actually got he pregnant a few months before we got together but she had a abortion she never told me about this nor did anyone else. After I found that out I went to sleep and in the morning the police called and said they had arrested him. and found him with a gun he stole from a guys truck after this all happened I kept getting messages from different numbers accusing me of basically anything they could she was even texting my mom on these numbers and telling her things like I was doing coke and shrooms this lasted pretty much all summer and when I went back to school the next year it became worse my first day back some guy came up and tried to attack me luckily my friend saw him about to hit me and pushed him I ended up in the dean‚Äôs office once again with me this random guy and her after spending literally the entire day in the deans office by myself with the occasional check in by by the dean he came in with the school resource officer and put me in cuffs what happened is her and like 5 of her friends told them I r@ped her and they believed them. after multiple hours with the police and telling them everything that had happened over the past year I was finally allowed to go home I didn‚Äôt go to school the next day cause f that but then the day after that I went back and she was gone it turned out between her being a f student having horrible attendance and accusing me of r@pe she was expelled a week later one of my friends told me she ended up overdosing after all the shit she did. I still feel like this is my fault somehow and barely sleep anymore aita.\n",

Later, she came to yell at me again; I told her she was being theatrical, but I feel like I was being dramatic because she was my mom after all.

I've been telling her no about getting a job since she was 13 because she already makes me of her good for nothing dad's house. So she had enough of me and went to ask her dad and her dad said yes and that she will doing yard work for him. I think that's absolutely appalling. I said that she couldn't get a job and she went by my back and got a job. I texted my ex-husband to tell him that I have said no numerous times. He told me it's not that big of a deal.  I found out by seeing $100 bill in her wallet. My husband has a history of doing this where I say no and he lets my daughters do it. He let both of my girls do cheerleading even though I said no. He let my 15 year old dye her hair pink even though I said no. Now he's letting her work. So I told my 15 year old that I will never give her any money ever again and that she can buy anything she wants because I'm not giving her anything besides for food and water and I know you're going to pay for her hygiene products. My 15 year old ran off crying and told her dad I was yelled at by her dad.\n",

My school only allowed us to play football/soccer in the cage which me and my friends didn‚Äôt want to because for the game we wanted to play required a small brick bench.

She immediately without questioning took him in and he was in trouble for it.

The teachers let me go but kept the remaining 29 students back. They would have to sit in a room in silence all lunch break which was an hour a day but I was let out. I was then told by some boys after school to own up that it was me and i responded ‚Äúnobody even wanted you to play, everyone was telling you to F off, that‚Äôs your fault you gotta miss out on your lunch‚Äù out of the 30 boys only 15 of them was meant to be playing the rest were just bums that wanted to join in even though we never really hung around a lot. \n",

I listened to her rant fir a while before stopping her and asking what she wanted me to do, she kept telling saying that when we had the baby she thought I was going to drop my hours and take more than 4 days off when our daughter was born. I told that I would have taken longer off but my job needed me. She started crying and saying that she needed me as she barely had time to eat breakfast let alone shower or wash her hair or do anything for herself because she constantly had to look after our daughter on her own.

My son has a Marine hat that he wears, and a kid came and said, \"Thank you for your service to my son.\" I find this a little cringeworthy because my kid is still a kid. He wasn't in the military for that long, so I cringe when people come and tell my son, \"Thank you for your service.\" I understand when children do this because they lack social awareness; however, recently a grown-up 30-year-old man came and told my son, \"Thank you for your service.\" My son is always polite and says thank you, and again, this grown-up man considered my son a \"veteran.\" I had to step in to correct him for one My son is not a \"veteran.\" He is 22 years old, and he went in at 18. He was in the military for 4 years, and like I said, he's just an adult. When people call ex-military \"veterans,\" usually these vets are old, like in their 40s and 50s, not 22-year old kids. He's not a \"veteran.\" Now I was never in the military and I never wanted to, but I feel like when people consider my kid a \"veteran,\" it's disrespectful towards people who have served more than just 4 years and have much more experience than a 22-year-old. After this encounter, my son asked me why I don't consider him a vet, and I told him why he walked away and hasn't talked to me.

A week ago, all of our power went out. There was a flash flood and it wiped out like 10 poles. So we don't have power currently but my sister does, because she has a generator. She said we could cook and shower there until the power comes back. Her house is literally not even 40 feet from ours so it works out great.

And I understand that's fucking irritating. But I don't think it warrants my wife simply not cooking (not just because of me!

      "So me and my gf of 3 months have been having intimacy related issues. She never wants to have sex, and it has been very hard to deal with. I don‚Äôt feel like I have an exceptionally high libido, I would like to do it maybe two or 3 times a week. She seems to never want to do it. She did have some sex related trauma following a SA, which happened 3/4 years ago and I have been understanding of that. Last week, her ex who she was with for just over a year (they broke up early this year) reached out to her, wanting to try again. She showed me, and told me she told him she was taken now, and not to contact her. They had an awful break up, which was also quite traumatic to her, after she found out he was cheating on her and leading on multiple other girls. It all came out after one of the girls he was sleeping with messaged her, and told her about another girl he was sleeping with, which then lead to another and another. The 5 of them added him to a group call and all confronted him and that was the last time she spoke to him. From my understanding they had been going through a rough patch, but she was still blindsided by it.\n",

      "He ended up getting into a relationship with one of the girls from the call literally the day after they broke up, which effected her badly and she was in a bad place when we met.

I found out this wasn‚Äôt the case this morning, as I saw he was in the top of her messages. I demanded to see it and she showed me, and they have basically been arguing all week, with her seemingly seeking closure, asking questions/details of the affairs. And between him begging for another chance and her asking questions she made one comment that really got to me.

After this I told her I wanted to see all their messages, or I would end things and she reluctantly agreed, but said they were the only messages between them since they broke up. This is seemingly true, but after going through their other chats I discovered that she would sleep him constantly. Like 4-5 times a day sometimes, and a lot of their chats were very sexual. And she was also initiating most of them, saying things about how much she couldn‚Äôt wait to blow him (something we have never done, due to her past trauma) and one comment which is burned into my mind is her saying ‚Äúlately when you‚Äôve been pinning me against the wall it‚Äôs like my p*ssy is screaming for you‚Äù. I also saw that she slept with him the second time they met, where as we had been dating for 2 months and together for one month before we ever did it. \n",

She then told me that he had ‚Äúhelped heal her‚Äù from that trauma. I said if she is healed then why does it effect our intimacy so much, and she admitted that it doesn‚Äôt really. She isn‚Äôt scared to be intimate with me like she has made out, she just doesn‚Äôt enjoy it with me. She said doing it with me does nothing for her, and that this is how it has been with every person she‚Äôs been with apart from her ex, and that before she met him she thought that either there was something wrong with her, or sex was just really really overrated. She said that he is the only person to ever make her enjoy sex, and want to have sex. \n",

Maybe my brother had missed what i heard but it just felt like she was objectifying him. I firmly told her to stop objectifying my brother and to stop with the uncomfortable micro aggressions. I brought up the fact that she felt way too comfortable saying these things and that she needs to think before she says things. I know now that there was no malice behind her words but i felt so drained after the barbecue that i had to say something. \n",

We went through some life changes and I revoked the with benefits aspect, though even afterwards we were more physical and cuddly than I usually am with my friends. We've both since moved away, and nowadays, we occasionally DM each other, but I don't know much about his life, nor he about mine. I don't think I've actually hung out with him in 5 years, though during the pandemic we'd call each other sometimes. Neither of us is married, and I'm 80% sure he doesn't currently have a significant other either.\n",

We were both part of the same friend group, and he'd always want to hang out the most often, always wanted to stay out later, do more things, and generally wanted more from the friend group than the friend group was willing to give. I'm a recovering people pleaser, so I often would oblige even after everyone else bailed because I felt bad - dude was obviously having a hard time adjusting post-college, had never lived more than 3 hours from his hometown, went to college with some of his childhood friends, generally had no idea to be okay with himself. I suspect he was dealing with depression at the time.\n",

The first time we were physical, was a time like this - everyone else left, I felt bad for him and stayed to watch a movie, he dimmed the lights and after like 20 minutes, he made out with me (which I wasn't expecting, but was okay with) and we cuddled and I don't remember well because it was a long time ago now, but I don't think I spent the night.\n",

      "This turned into a long, drawn out fwb situation where I never reallyyyy wanted to be more than friends, but I felt bad saying no/he was my only real prospect at the time so I'd wind up allowing him to be physical with me. There were sometimes where I would actually say no, but eventually would give in.\n",

      "As I mentioned above, we went through some life changes and I took the opportunity to draw a line and say that the fwb situation wasn't healthy for us, and we're not going to be anything more than friends anymore.

I had tried to broach the subject when we were close enough to have that kind of conversation, but he would react massively defensively if I even hinted that our encounters weren't always 100% consensual, and I was never able to get him to reflect. Now that he's older (I hope) he's more mature and maybe is more willing to listen/self-reflect, but we're no longer close and I don't really feel comfortable talking to him about it.

      "I pretended to be happy, because I didn‚Äôt want to seem ungrateful, but really? 5 years together and he can‚Äôt muster up anything more than what other students do with people they haven‚Äôt even been dating? I know he wasn‚Äôt busy, he does nothing all day except hangout with friends and play video games (barely any homework pretty much ever, no job, no extracurriculars except basketball, which ended).

      "- No, my boyfriend does not do much in the relationship. He used to, but as of late he‚Äôs gotten really lazy. The most he does is (his parents) pay for when we eat out. Otherwise he doesn‚Äôt do much in this relationship or in his own life. I have plenty of frustrations with both of those things, but whatever.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Yes, nowadays (at least at my school) people do elaborate promposals. That‚Äôs just the norm now. How would you feel if most people did something sweet for their SO/prom date and yours was one of the few lazy ones? I‚Äôm not angry or incredibly upset, just disappointed and felt guilty for being disappointed. Even something like a picnic promposal would‚Äôve been nice.\n",

      "- No, I did not specifically ask him. I understand that is my fault. We‚Äôve been together for 5 years and he knows I like romantic stuff, so I thought that, mixed with me telling him how cool I thought the promposals were, would be enough. He also used to get my hints, but in the past 6 months to a year he‚Äôs stopped. It makes me feel more like it‚Äôs a deliberate disregard for what I like rather than him not knowing.\n",

      "I think the general consensus is NTA/NAH, or a soft YTA for my lack of communication. I also get a lot of people are older, or grew up in a place that didn‚Äôt have a culture around promposals so they think the whole thing is just ridiculous. That‚Äôs okay, but I‚Äôm not really going to be considering those comments much since they seem significantly more upset with the culture (which is not created by me) than me feeling a little bummed about getting something that isn‚Äôt the norm in *my* culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, small update, but I spoke with my boyfriend about things and we‚Äôre figuring stuff out. I think he‚Äôs finally starting to understand some of my exasperation (despite this not being the first talk we‚Äôve had!) but only time and actions will tell. If nothing changes by college, we‚Äôre simply breaking up. The comments were very helpful with giving me ideas on what to talk about and address.\n",

      "So my sister (32) and i (30F) both had a baby 3 weeks a part. She had her son first and my husband and i went to see them when he was maybe a week old. The problem is my sister is still very scared of Covid so we could only see the baby through her patio door, she wouldn‚Äôt even open a bit on the other side so we could hear eachother talk. I understood then cause he didn‚Äôt get his first vaccines.  I then had my daughter and she never asked to come see her (i also have a patio door in the back). About a month ago she invited us outside with my mom and brother, we had to wear N95 masks, but we were able to hold the baby, which was great and i also brought my daughter. While we were there she asked my husband if we were gonna vaccinate our child against covid when she‚Äôs 6 months, my husband said hell no. My sister then said it was really important and we really should, my husband just changed subjet cause he didn‚Äôt wanna argue with her. Last week, i asked her if she was coming to my daughter‚Äôs baptism in November and she said no unless people wear masks. I said well there is no mandate so obviously no one will wear one, but she could wear one herself if she wanted to, she still said no. This week my mom went to see her and her son and i saw the video my sister sent us in our group chat, my mom was waving from the patio door closed, so now its back to that and no one is allowed to hold her son anymore or to be in contact with her unless it‚Äôs this way. I wrote (and this is prob where i might be the ah) : oh what happened Covid came back in your backyard?! She then wrote me a bible and told me that it was my problem if i wanted my daughter to catch covid and get sick. That‚Äôs when i told myself Ok, this Covid thing will always scare her and we can‚Äôt do anything about it, I‚Äôm done trying to reason with her. So i just blocked her from everywhere. I get that she can do wtv she wants with her son but one day we can see him and the next its back to the patio door again. My mom won‚Äôt be able to hold him again the whole winter because its ‚Äò‚Äôcovid season‚Äô‚Äô. Its pretty sad cause my daughter will never be close to her only cousin. I told my mom she can contact me through her when she starts therapy, cause she truly need it. So am i the ah for blocking her and moving on?! Thanks!\n",

      "Last weekend I went out with some friends and got into a little something. I‚Äôm a 28F and my best friend is a 29F, I‚Äôll call her Jess for this post. We‚Äôve been friends since 8th grade and Jess has always had lots of attention from men. She‚Äôs a very attractive latina with a FAT ass lol. Small waist but HUGE booty cheeks and great legs. So she‚Äôs had lots of attention and from really attractive muscular guys and even rich guys. Lots of ex bfs or flings who didn‚Äôt stick. Her man, Drew 32M, is a great guy. But he is kinda lucky he was able to get with Jess considering how many super hot and/or rich guys were after her. He‚Äôs short and has a receding hairline and has a nice job (accountant) but isn‚Äôt close to rich or well off. NOTHING is wrong with that, he just definitely hit the jackpot getting her considering she‚Äôs had(or even been with) tall buff conventionally attractive guys with some money. He‚Äôs kinda muscular himself, sometimes pretty funny, can fight(saw him beat up a bigger guy when said guy slapped Jess‚Äôs butt) and has a big dick according to Jess so yes I can list his positive traits too. But still, definitely lucky he snagged her.\n",

      "The three of us were out drinking along with my bf. Drew excused himself to the restroom for a bit. While the rest of us were chatting this guy came up to Jess to start hitting on her and trying to get her to come back to his place. He was being corny and trying to tell her about his expensive car lol. Jess does what she usually does and gets their hopes up for a bit before turning them down. Drew comes back and we tell him what happened, playing it off as a joke. Nothing that hasn‚Äôt happened before. The guy was kinda hot and seemed to have money tho. So I just said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky to have her with guys like that constantly hitting on her before you two got together.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt trying to be rude, I thought it was an inoffensive comment. But Drew was like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean?‚Äù I‚Äôm saying‚ÄùUhh what do you mean? I‚Äôm just saying she had lots of guys after her ass so you‚Äôre lucky you got to be the one who ends up with her‚Ä¶‚Äù But Drew is like‚ÄùOk well it sounds like you‚Äôre trying to say those guys are better than me and that Jess settled for me after she had her fun with guys like that.‚Äù Lol bro you said it not me üíÄSo we‚Äôre just like bro calm down. Drew kinda sulks quietly and Jess is like are you still upset and he‚Äôs like no but he totally was üíÄ. Jess whispers to me to just apologize but I say no, not about to apologize over nothing.

He said he did it because he felt like he was losing me and instead of talking to me about it he thought getting me pregnant would be easier. He said he was sorry and he thought it was the best option. I started crying and laughing, i told him i don't understand I've always been 100% honest with him even when he wanted to stop using condoms. Yes i know in that last update i said we both agree not to use them but it was his idea and he said he wanted to be closer to me. I know this could've al been avoided if i put my foot down about the condoms but its always what i want so i feel like i had to give him that. I asked him to leave and i needed some time, he's at work now and now i just crying because instead of talking to me he thought getting me pregnant was the best and only choice. I know he's in the wrong but i still feel like the A. Like i don't understand why he feels like he's losing me he comes over almost every morning and i make him breakfast he's always with my family or im with his.

He looks the same, acts the same, and I love him a lot.\n",

He was finally getting what he needed, and I didn‚Äôt feel guilty about not giving it to him. Then he met a woman who he really liked. She was also in a poly relationship with multiple partners. They had a steady schedule for a few months. I had more free time so I decided to go out with some friends. One night, I met someone. He asked me out, and I figured why not?\n",
      "It was during this first date with another man where I realized I was not asexual. I really wanted to have sex with him. At first, I felt guilty.

      "This went on for a few months. I‚Äôd hook up with this guy while my partner was out with his girl. Nothing else about our relationship changed. In fact, things between us only improved. Until his girl dumped him. Immediately he began asking about when we were going to be intimate again. He had gone from daily sex to nothing overnight. And now he was having trouble ‚Äúfinding a replacement for her‚Äù. And he ‚Äúalways needs somebody, doesn‚Äôt really matter who‚Äù otherwise he feels lonely. \n",

Kim when she was in her sophomore year of college was seeing this guy call him Jay. Jay a D1 basketball player and was going to the NBA (in practice squad). Jay also had a fianc√© at the time. Kim did not care, and got herself pregnant with Jay‚Äôs baby. Jay gave her $300 for an abortion and to leave him alone.

She told me that I was being dumb and that me judging her for her actions in college is stupid and asked me all the dumb things I did back then. She then starts saying that it is the first time that Trey has had a positive role male model in his life and that I am not just blowing up our relationship but mine with Trey as well.

The time for the ‚Äústudy group‚Äù rolled around and when no one showed up but her, I pretended everyone bailed, and we were finally left alone to get to know each other. But to my surprise, she told other people from class about the group and all of these random people showed up. She quickly figured out my plan and seems convinced I‚Äôm an asshole, so I‚Äôm turning to reddit for help. I think I just proved how much I‚Äôm interested in her, but she thinks otherwise.\n",

      "I (M39) am *very* successful in my career, and recently was promoted to a highly prestigious position within my company. With my promotion came a *substantial* bonus (high 4 figures). My 4 month anniversary with my girlfriend (F24) was coming up, and I‚Äôm a generous guy, so I decided to go to my local jeweler to pick out something special for her. I spent a good amount of time, around 25 minutes, looking for something that I knew she would like. I know she currently wears a low end watch (Michael Kors) and it‚Äôs a little embarrassing when we go out to expensive restaurants. Especially because I wear a custom Breitling. Long story short, I found her a relatively used Rolex (rare) that my jeweler recommended. \n",
      "\n",
      "On our anniversary, she came over to my home to get ready for our outing. I had dinner plans/reservations already made at my favorite restaurant. I was planning on giving her the watch at the restaurant. But, as we were about to leave she started putting on her old watch, and I decided to just give her the new one right before we left so she would fit in better with the type of people who would also be dining at this particular restaurant (very upscale). I handed her an elegantly wrapped box with the watch inside, and told her, ‚ÄúI want you to wear this whenever we go out together from now on, baby.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, she opened the box and did **not** react how I had expected. Instead of excitement and gratitude, she just looked at me blankly before giving me a quick smile and a short ‚Äúthanks.‚Äù She then just put the watch in her bag, leaving her old watch on her wrist. Then she asked if I was ready to go. I told her I was ready but I was confused why she wasn‚Äôt putting the watch on. I asked her and she explained that her current watch was a gift from her late mother, who passed away last month. I told her I understand that it‚Äôs special to her, but she can wear it any other time, and I just spent my entire bonus on this gift and I was looking forward to seeing her wear it to my favorite restaurant on our anniversary. I thought it would make her feel like she belongs. She responded telling me she would rather wear her old watch. This went back and forth and I voiced how disappointed I was, considering all the time I spent picking out + the cost. We reached an impasse, she was refusing to switch watches. \n",

      "I told her I felt like she was ruining what was supposed to be a special night. I told her if she wasn‚Äôt going to put it on, then I was just going to leave without her. She said I was being unreasonable but I just had expected her to be grateful for the generous gift. Instead she was acting like a brat, and I felt unappreciated and disrespected. I kept the reservation and I went by myself. But before I left I told her that I would call her an Uber and to text me when she is ready to apologize.

      "Once I arrived, I met up with Daphne and the other two women, and they took me to my husband. I will never forget the look on his face. He was surprised, mad and confused all at once. When I saw him, I immediately started screaming at him, and told him I was talking to a divorce lawyer.\n",

They have only been with each other and last year decided that they would venture out and explore other people for a sexual experience since they have only had sex with each other, so they gave each other a \"hall pass\" to sleep with one person. After a couple months or so my guy friend met someone and had sex with her.  His wife didn't. When he asked if she really wanted to or if she was just letting him do it, she joked \"If you want me to use it so bad I'll just use it on one of your friends\" and apparently that kind of appealed to him. They discussed it and he said he would actually prefer that because it would actually give him piece of mind knowing she's not going to be with someone that would mistreat or hurt her. He said he knew a couple friends that had slept with mutual girls and it didn't hurt their friendship but he would clear it with the friend first.\n",

He said he was telling me because she's crazy anxious and nervous about stuff like this and has tried \"hitting on me\" but I never paid it any mind because I see her as his wife and saw nothing about it with that intent. When I asked why me, he said he didn't know. He actually didn't. He asked whether or not I say yes or no, that this be between me and him and none of the rest of the friend group find out. Which I agreed.\n",

      "I end up texting her later that evening to ask and explain stuff. We spoke for a little about to make sure that she was actually okay with it and got it in a text that I didn't want to be used for future arguments if they were to take place when she hits me with it. \"(my ex gf) would brag about you being a large guy, is it true?\" which I confirmed and she asked for a picture for proof. I asked if that was actually okay to do with what we were doing and she said it was fine. She followed with saying \"If anything, if I don't want it, I saw it and this wont happen\" Cool. No problem. I send a picture. We talk a little more about it and agree if we both want to do this I don't want to do it at my house or at hers. She offered to get a hotel room and we do it there. I call my friend and ask \"Hey I talked with (wife) and she wants to. I mean sex is sex with me, nothing attached of course.\" and he said yes and thanked me for doing this and reaffirmed that NOONE in the friend group needed to talk about this.\n",

As time past she would make subtle comments joking about size and stuff towards me. She knows that, while when its in an intimate setting I love the praise, if its in a public setting it makes me shy and I just have to play it off. Nothing too crazy just teasing comments like we make towards any friends. I should add, no one in this friend group knows I'm a well endowed guy.( I found earlier in life guys act differently towards you when they find out. So I don't spread the word that I am.)\n",

I had a long talk with him about it where he explained all of this to me after his wife asked me to reach out to talk to him because I was the only other person that knew about any of this. When we talked he explained his curiosity on why all of a sudden she wanted to use bigger toys and such. So he snooped through her phone and went through the conversation with me and her and saw the picture I sent her, and he was now mad that I didn't tell him I was hung. That if he would've known that I was that big he wouldn't have agreed to let her sleep with me.\n",

      "I just can't help but feel bad that I should have maybe told him? I mean I didn't know how big he is either. But I can't help but feel bad that I might have opened a door for her that it's not something he can control about himself.\n",

      "Important information: My current gf knows about the whole situation now and doesn't hold it against any of us as long as there was consent across the board, but didn't know that joking about my size was something that didn't happen in this friend group.

Well that particular day she felt ill and wasn't really herself. That night she split really badly and went to the bedroom. I went to speak to her she started shouting at me saying I didn't care about her that I was giving the dog all the attention and I noticed she had downloaded dating apps on her phone. Of course I did lose my cool slightly as I've been cheated on in the past and this made me feel rather upset. So I told her to leave that just because she never got as much attention today due to a dog is no reason to download dating apps and scream at me.\n",

I did go after her and she started screaming and shouting in the streets that I was trying to kill her she flung and broke her phone stormed off hit me and continued shouting that I was trying to kill her needles to say the street called the authorities and about 20 minutes later the police arrived and I had to sit and explain the situation. \n",

      "I (21F) share a college room with this girl (21F). In the past few weeks I've been hooking up with two guys from college, let's call them J and M. I made it clear to both of them that I want to keep things casual and no strings attached and I'm not looking to be exclusive right now. I thought they'd both got the message, but 2 days ago both of them got into a fight with each other at a frat party, to the point J even needed to be sent to the hospital. My girlfriends all told me that the reason they've got into a fight was over me and that both of them apparently want to make our relationship exclusive.\n",

I quickly ask her wtf did she say about me and she says that I've heard her and that everyone knows I'm a fickle slut who has her eye on everyone, even the college's janitor. I tell her that I definitely won't have it on her anymore (I forgot to mention, but me and my roommate have also \"experimented\" in the past) as jealous bitches aren't my type. She then went on a rant about me acting like the queen of the world who thins everyone wants her, but I told her that at least I don't act like a pressed pick-me who no one wants. \n",

      "Frankly, we definitely would've gotten into a fight as well if not for my other girlfriends separating us, but now our group has been torn apart as some of them did actually side with her over me. Not to mention that I plan to change rooms now as I don't plan to keep living with her any second longer. I definitely think this was just her jealousy speaking cause no boy wants her (or that I don't want her), but I do wonder if I may have gone a bit overboard as well, cause as I've said already, some people did actually side with her over me.\n",

I'm talking about not throwing the garbage when she's supposed to, putting soda cans under the couch etc. She also doesn't even clean her bathroom and it's honestly a pigsty in there with her used tampons on the counter and shit stains in the toilet. I spoke to her many times and we've had many heated arguments about keeping her end of the bargain. She'll do it for a few days and then go back to normal.

I yelled for Maddie to come downstairs. She didn't answer so I went up to her room and walked in. She was having sex with her boyfriend on the floor. When she saw me she squealed. I didn't care, I just grabbed her hand and took her naked ass downstairs to show her what she had done. I told her she could have burned the house down with her carelessness.

      "Hi, I'm female (25), and I was dating my ex male (24) we met on tinder, we were only together for 4 months. My ex broke up with me on Saturday morning via text, I was working and looking at the text messages during my break, I broke down and drove to his place crying for him to talk to me face to face.  He was only annoyed and worried about what his housemate will think of him if he let them see me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "When we were dating, things never went easy, he was dealing with leaving a toxic housemate before dating, and slightly at the beginning of getting to know him. Our first date was great, I was like wow, he is perfect. He called himself a gentleman, he was on his best behaviour, we had to reschedule the first date because he cancelled last minutes before the first date. We split everything 50/50, we spent over 9 hours together, just talking and exploring the city. \n",
      "\n",
      "After the first date, he confined in me, that he is stressed with looking for a new place to live, how his housemate only gave him a week notice, being extremely toxic. I offered to help him move house with my car because he doesn't have a car, on my day off. He was so thankful and told me that no one ever treated me so kindly before and that he didn't deserve me. I told him that \"I'm treating him the way I would want to be treated\" and he promised me that he will remember this, and will treat me the same way. He told me that if he promised something, he would always keep his promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we finished the second date, I asked him \"So are we exclusive? Or still talking to other people?\"\n",
      "He told me that he wants to be exclusive, that he uninstalled tinder from the first date but he doesn't like labels. It was too late, it has been a long day and I just wanted to go home, knowing that they will be a 45 minute drive home. \n",
      "\n",
      " The next date, I left my phone in the uber by accident, he let me stay the night and took care of me throughout, reassuring me and making me feel safe, he was amazing that night, I felt secure and safe. He brought pizza, we went shopping for ingredients the next day, I paid and he made breakfast, it was perfect. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After 4 weeks of dating, he confined in me again, that the workplace that he loves is closing down, and that he will lose his job within 8 weeks, the boss was kind and gave them all 8 weeks notice, but unfortunately his hours was cut down dramatically. I told him that until he is back on his feet, I am willing to pay for all dates moving forward. He can start paying for the dates after he becomes more stable again  He was thankful again and told me that he is so thankful to have met me. We started dating the second time we met up, the day he moved house. His mum called and told me that she is so thankful that he has someone like me by his side. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told him early on, while we were in tinder that my bare minimum is for the guy to have both a licence and a job. He told me that he has got both, he just doesn't have a car since he doesn't need it. I understand that having a car right now is not necessary, having amazing transport in my city. I believed him and never doubted him for a second. He told me that if he needed to, he can borrow his neighbour car, so I know that it's a working licence. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tend to finish the date and reflect, analysing the day and ask him to explain himself a few days later, about what he meant, never angry, never accusations, just need an explanation. We often patch it fairly quickly, just proper communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was over at his place one time, he was super tired by 7pm, and made me feel unwanted, with \"I'm sooooo tired, sooo tired\" I felt like I was unwanted and suggested to leave after awhile, his reaction was \"Oh yes! That would be great!\" I didn't feel great and spoke to him about it via text a few days after. Letting him know that it made me upset. He defended himself telling me that it's rude to ask a guest to leave, or to kick a guest out. I told him that I would prefer it if he told me \"hey, I'm really tired, I don't think I can stay awake for much longer\". He asked me if I've got some personality disorder that made it hard to read the social cues, and that it was my fault for not being able to read the room. He told me that I was different than other girls and that not everyone like it as bluntly as I do. \n",
      "\n",
      "We decided after communication that he had to deal with his ex in a certain way and that he was so used to handling things in an immature way. I brought up the topic about our dating situation, how he told me that he doesn't like labels. He explained that he doesn't like the labels boyfriend and girlfriend, it reminds him of immature teenagers, he prefer other labels such as partners, significant other or lover. We patch the misunderstanding and moved on without any voice being raised. \n",
      "\n",
      "After a few more weeks of dating, I noticed that every week, he will bring up the topic of his licence now-and-then. Every week being a different story. One day he has a licence, a working licence, second week he told me that he found out that his licence expired but he can easily renew it. Week afterwards he told me that it expired but he was on his P plate, not his full licence, and it was a Tasmania licence, he didn't swap it to a Western Australia licence before it expired. Finally he told me that due to it being a Tasmania licence, the system is different and that he either have to go back to Tasmania and renew it there, or start from the beginning. His plan was to start again, but wait until he is 25 (which was in a few months), before starting, since after 25, the required hours would be cut significantly, making it quicker and easier to get a licence. I called him out, let him explain himself and realised that it was just another misunderstanding. In his mind, he was just updating me as he went along, while it sounded like he was lying every week from my end. We patched it up with communication and moved on. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we started dating, we met in the middle, by the city at 10am, he would arrive by train and I would get there by car. I would pay for the lunch, the drinks and I will drive us back to his place to hang out for the afternoon and night, until I needed to head back home. Recently, we've just been skipping the city, and heading straight to his place, letting him sleep in, bringing breakfast over. I travelled over 1 hours due to traffic, getting ready in the morning while he would still be in his sleeping clothes, unshaven, barely awake. I did it for him. \n",
      "\n",
      "For my birthday, I told him that he didn't need to buy me any gift, just bake me a cake (he is a qualified baker), he and the cake and dinner. It was amazing. The next day we planned to meet up, to go to a market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Agreeing to meet up at the station, which was a lot closer to him than it is to me. I arrived, he wasn't there, I gave him a call and we realised that he was sleeping and just woke up with my phone call. He quickly got ready and went to meet up, it took him an hour. He explained to me that he have a sleeping issues, where some nights he might find it hard to fall asleep, and sometimes he will sleep for 20-48 hours straight. I didn't understand it but accepted it. He did apologize, and I didn't held any grudges, mistakes can happen.\n",
      "\n",
      " On the train, he told me that he gave this generic heart issue, that he will probably die at 40s anyway, all male in his family has it, he has been tested and definitely have the trait too, his uncle died pretty young, in his 40's, while being super active with a healthy lifestyle. I was upset, I wanted to know about our future if that was the case, we both wanted kids one day. He told me that it is beyond his control, it felt like a bombshell. I then asked him about his plans for 10 years, he told me that he wanted to travel the world, live in the USA for awhile. I was never part of this plan. I asked him about the other plan that he also made about future kids and family, he told me that his plan comes first, but it doesn't have to be 10 years of travelling, it can just be a few years of travelling, cut short if 2 or years, telling me that females can get pregnant at age 40s anyway. I want to be done with kids by late 30s max, knowing that it's harder for females, later on in life. He kept me interested by promising a future earlier on, thinking we were on the same page, and also claiming that his plan can be altered, which is fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him, moving forward, if he can tell me \"Good morning, how was the drive? Thank you for driving all the way here\", because it takes over an hour drive with traffic. While picking up breakfast on the way, explaining to him that I want to know that he acknowledged my efforts. He told me \"I don't see why it's any effort for you to drive all the way to see me, I'm doing you a favour, I'm saving you money for parking, and you usually head there early for parking anyway\". I told him that it shouldn't be that hard of a task, and to try. I also asked him to try and message me first in the morning, instead of me always messaging him, if I never message him first, he might never message me. \n",
      "\n",
      "We spoke about it. He told me that he can't do this anymore, that he want to break up. He then blocked my number, and blocked me on discord, but somehow, unblocked me. I told him that I felt used, I've been nothing but good to him and that he run away when things get hard. He was on the call with me, telling me for 15 minutes straight that I was unlovable, that no one will love me with my personal, always calling people out, that no guys that he knows would be able to put up with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've called him out for the big details, always talking, hearing him out, letting him explain his side. \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him if we can try, I hate giving up, it isn't in me to give up, after investing so much energy, so much money. He finally gave in and agreed to try again. The next day, he ghosted me completely, I waited 24 hours before I messaged him \"so, are we done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      " If it doesn't work the second time, it isn't meant to be. Our first date after the fight took awhile to arrange, he was always sick/working, and I couldn't see him for awhile.  When we did meet up again, I drove over with food, I came dressed up, super nicely, and he did everything I asked of him, he asked me \"how was the drive? Thank you for driving here\" and acted like he cared. We went shopping for food, he cooked, he made us an amazing dinners. We attempted sexy time but neither one of us was into it. Mostly him. I went home, thanking him for putting in the effort and time, telling him that it meant a lot to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the next few weeks after, he will tell me \"I will call you tomorrow\" and tomorrow comes, he would not have time to call. It was like that for awhile. Wednesday was his day off and he told me that he will definitely try on Wednesday, but he was busy dealing with personal issues. I was upset but accepted it. I tried to make it work, I will send him messages where he will respond rarely. He has been distance for weeks, I felt neglected. \n",
      "\n",
      "He did told me once that if he told me that he will do something, he will always keep his words. He told me that he will call me tomorrow, he probably forgot about the workplace party, and I asked him at 9pm if he will be able to call tonight, it if I should sleep and not wait for him. He messaged once to tell me that he was busy. He messaged at 11:30pm to tell me not to wait for him, that he can't call. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was upset and told him, can we organise any phone calls, instead of a \"maybe i will\" and \"definitely tomorrow\", and tomorrow is another disappointment. He told me that he never promised, he only told me that he will, and that he does keep his promises, him claiming that he will is not the same as claiming that he promised. Unless there is a promise in it, he might do it. \n",
      "\n",
      "He responded at 9am Saturday morning. Telling me that he is breaking up with me, that I'm too much to handle. I wanted the bare minimum... \n",
      "\n",
      "I saw the message while I was at work at 10, left early crying, I drove straight to him to get him to tell me to my face. He told me that he regretted that I manipulated him into staying, that he should have left awhile ago, that I made him feel guilty since I told him that I've done so much for him. Which I have. He can't deny it. \n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that the last time he had sex with me. He felt dirty, and that he hated it. He was the one that made the move, it was not great for me neither, never has been. He told me that I can't compare to his ex, that she is the love of his life. How if she was still alive they would ge married with kids by now, he got an engagement ring ready, and to try and sleep with anyone beside her felt wrong. I was hurt and crying, he was all calm and cold, smiling now and then, while getting distracted by cars that drove by. I told him that he never asked me \"how have you been?\" And whenever we don't talk on the phone recently, it was all about him, how he was coping with work, his new jobs. Everything is about him. He told me that he know, he used to ask me about how I was and he used to care, he just stop caring. He told me that if I wanted to, I can message him my bank details and he will pay me back \n",
      "\n",
      "I called him a narcissistic, he told me that he is a psychopath, been tested and usually it takes people longer to notice, and congratulations for picking it up quicker than others, in such an happy tone, so chill.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left crying. I messaged him l days later, spamming him about all of the wrong I've suffered, how I've only noticed it now. I spammed him, hoping that he can see where I'm coming from. He got annoyed, told me to stop, and that if I ever dare come over again, he will get a restraining order on me. I wanted my cap and shirt back but he told me that he will leave it outside the door, I can pick it up, but not to come unannounced again. I kept asking him if he will pay me back the money for the dates, he never answer, always ignoring it, always blaming me for being crazy for coming that one time unannounced. That it was the rudes thing anyone can ever do. He did break up with me from a text message. I did left work crying, it was on impulse. \n",
      "\n",
      "He admitted that he did lied about the licence, knowing that I wouldn't consider dating a guy without a job and a licence. He told me that he does have a licence, knowing full well that he didn't, and change the lie every week, hoping that I didn't call him out on it, but I did, and I trusted his lies. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted him to hand it to me face to face, he told me that he refused to see me. I don't want to degrade myself by picking it from the floor.\n",
      "Admitted I felt wrong and used l kept trying to make him understand how he made me feel, he is so selfish that he can never see my point of view. I deserve more. \n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed because my parents stay together, there will be bad days and good day. I thought, he is stressed with work, things are just temporary, I should be there for him, give him emotional support and show him that I'm there for him. I didn't want to give up. I genuinely thought that things will get better, once he is less stress, less work and less worries. Things can go back to how it was, when we were in the early stages of love bombing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And just now, he told me that he won't pay me back, that it was my decision to pay for the dates and he doesn't think I deserve it, I rather use me and want nothing to do with me anymore. And that he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. I spent so much money on him, always driving him home from a date, always paying for the dates. Telling me that he threw my things out, not to come over or will get a restraining order, threatening me with the CCVC in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him that I've done so much, and he will treat me like this. I called him out for not being a true gentleman, that he isn't a good guy , he denied, telling me that his ex mum would call him a gentleman. I don't think a gentleman or a good guy should ever treat their partner with negligence and emotional abuse.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked if he can be there for me, I'm going to a bit, with mental health, he told me that he wants nothing to do with me. Telling me that I'm on my own, rely on other people, he will not be there for me. I've listen to him telling me about his abuse, his abusive ex, his abusive coworkers, terrible coworkers that he had issues with. I needed him to be there for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I always thought that abuse in a relationship would be so easy to spot, why are other people blindly dating a narcissist? But it's so easy to pick up abuse, if they have you a black eye, sometimes it's only possible if you let yourself see it. I kept on making excuses for him, telling my friends that he is a lovely guy, that he is going through a lot, and that things will get better. I was waiting for him to get back on the truck with life, be more stable, we can go on  dates, he can go back to how he was. When he was being nice. But that was the love bombing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept on making me sound like the crazy person for coming over an ex, unannounced straight after a break up text, as if that is the worst thing anyone can do. I never lay a hand on him, I never shouted. I was too busy crying. AITA for driving over to see him, after he texted me that we were over?\n",
      "\n",
      "Update, the last time I saw him (day we broke up), he told me that he will pay me back for everything, to just send him my bank details. When I did, he just told me that he wouldn't, it was my choice and I never let him pay. He never tried to pay. I spent a few hundreds on him. Again, always keeping his words, classic. So stringy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want him, I'm able to see his true colour. And to be honest, we had a great time for the first part. He was only able to show his true colour within the last 3 weeks, and definitely after the break up. He did work 5 days a week, over 12 hours a day for the last 2 weeks of dating, he was stressed and busy. His true character shines by the last 2 weeks of dating, being extremely disinterested, but I blamed that on being tired, overworked and getting sick often, using that as an excuse for the neglect. I let him push me to the side, knowing that his financial situation should be his first priority at the time. I am seeking therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To clarify, this story happened 3-4 years ago; although I recently brought it up to someone, and they said I was TA, which prodded me to seek an unbiased 3rd party opinion. Nothing to prove here, really, I guess I just want to know if I was an asshole or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, back in 2020 (ish), I was roommates with my (married) coworker. One day, we had both worked the same 12 hour shift with no breaks (which was the daily norm, but that's not the point), and we both came home sweaty, tired, bloody knuckles, covered in grease, and overall beaten and in need of a shower.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as we walked in the door, we were greeted by his wife (unemployed, for reference), who immediately started complaining about how difficult it was to take care of one singular 3 year old kid all day and how she wished she could've switched jobs with us, and that we were just so lucky.\n",
      "\n",
      "For context, I am the oldest of 6 kids, and I practically raised all 5 of my siblings due to deadbeat parents, so I full well know how difficult it is to raise a kid. Maybe not the financial side (but she didn't even have to worry about that part since her husband took care of her), but everything else, yeah, man, I completely get it. Kids suck. Kids are stressful. But if you know how to handle them and get used to their whining, it's...it's really not that bad, man. Like, I could understand a single mother with 2 full time jobs and 4 kids, yeah, that would suck. But she was unemployed with 1 kid to take care of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I'm getting off track.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the night went on, we (my roommate and I, his wife didn't drink) got pretty tipsy, so maybe it was the alcohol talking on my part. But it got to the point, where after literal *hours* of listening to her complain about how hard it is to be a stay at home mom, I couldn't take it anymore, and I said \"well, go get a job then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She immediately took it personally and said \"but who will take care of the kid?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the part where I may be TA.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then said \"Maybe you should hire the neighbor's daughter to watch the kid while you're at work. She's, what, 12? 13? Plenty old enough to be able to take care of a toddler without even having to change out of her pajamas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She took it as an insult. And, honestly, I meant it as one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe a justified insult. Maybe not. I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, it's just that...she saw both me and her husband get home, bleeding, greasy, smelly, and tired, after a 12 hour shift, while she did nothing all day but feed the kid chicken nuggets and play Paw Patrol for him while she scrolled through tiktok (that isn't an exaggeration, that is literally what she told us she did). And yet, she wanted *us* to listen to how hard of a day *she* had had, and immediately dismissed any complaints we had about our jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when I broke the news to her that hey, maybe putting on Netflix and microwaving chicken nuggets *isn't* the hardest thing in the world, she freaked out on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, long story short. She broke down crying and ran to her room. My roommate straight up told me (paraphrasing)  \"look, man. I agree with you here. but she's also still my wife. if this comes up in the future, I'm taking her side.\" I feel as though that was a reasonable stance on his part.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I guess my point is, to simplify it: AITAH for basically telling a woman that watching one singular toddler for the day, doing nothing but playing netflix for him and giving him microwaved food, is significantly easier than being a blue collar worker (or at least my specific blue collar job)?\n",
      "\n",
      "PS: she also insisted that her husband and I (even though I wasn't related to them in *any* way, and only lived with then because I happened to work with a guy who needed a roommate) take 100% care and responsibility for the kid when we got home so she could go \"unwind\"? At least a couple nights out of the week, full responsibility of the kid was left to me (without my say so), so husband and wife could spend time together. Also, oftentimes I had to discipline the kid, because they were so lax on him that he wouldn't listen to them, but he respected me, so when they *really* wanted something done, they'd say \"OP, intervene.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So AITAH for calling her out for, essentially, having it easy and being all around lazy?\n",
      "\n",
      "So my husband had a seven month affair last year, with a bitch he met as a client. She saw the pictures of his family and knew he was married with kids and made the choice to pursue him. Now, I‚Äôm not conflicted on what was to be done about him or where we stand in reference to him as I have dealt with that already however, I still feel like this bitch needs to learn a lesson. When I got in touch with her after I figured the entire situationship out, the bitch would not, I mean wouldn‚Äôt utter a single word to me. I found messages of her telling him she was going to give him keys to her apartment (which she did and I found but later threw them away) and telling him to leave me because she was falling in love with him. He never left our home during the time the affair was happening but she was persistent and was even complaining about him answering the phone for his kids while he was in her company  per the many text messages. \n",
      "Longer story short, I have literally all of her info, full name, job, address, phone number and even where her family is from. I want her to feel anxiety and embarrassed and all the things she deserves for being a piece of shit and actively pursuing and participating and even plotting to remove a man from his family for her own pleasure (FYI: he is well to do financially & she was counting on that being hers). What do I do to get this feeling off my chest cause although it‚Äôs been over for months, I feel like she hasn‚Äôt gotten the reward she deserves for playing with fire. Do I publish all of her info and let the world have at her?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay so I just had to type this, it's 4:30 in the morning and I can't sleep because my head is spinning and I feel like I'm going crazy. I don't know what else to do, all my friends are sleeping and I just need some clarity so I can fall asleep and figure out how to handle this situation going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I posted a few weeks ago about my new male neighbour who is 48 and who has slowly but surely been picking his way into my life and I don't like it at all. He initially seemed pretty nice and friendly and I didn't think much of it. He's still friendly and nice in a way, but it's getting too much, and very inappropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reference, I'm 25 and I've been in a committed and happy relationship for almost 3 years now. I was abused by my parents growing up so I know full well what manipulation and downplaying can do (thankfully I'm out of that situation), although I feel like I'm subconsciously still giving off some vulnerable victim vibes to potential perpetrators. Don't know how else to describe it. I know how to handle myself and I've been really good with setting boundaries and expressing my opinion since I yeeted/yote out of my parents' house, but somehow this guy just seems to trample over me in a way that I can't control and it makes me feel so stupid and disgusted with myself. I honestly feel like he's taking advantage of my loving and forgiving nature, and my people-pleasing side kicks in, causing my boundaries to just fall apart, and that's where it gets scary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind, I live in a garden flat with just a wall separating his bedroom and living room from mine, and his front door is a meter or two away from mine. I can also hear through the wall when he farts or talks on the phone or opens a soda, but I guess that's beside the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anywho, I avoided him for a whole month after our first encounter because I just didn't want to deal, and I have my own life with my own issues. I don't have to spend time with my new neighbour if I don't want to. At least, that's my boundaries talking. (Feel free to go look through my posts if you want to read about our first encounter, but it's not super important.) Basically, he's just been testing the waters to be inappropriate towards me, but in a joking way, while also saying that he's just being honest and would never lie to me because he values honesty and truth and trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, after my boyfriend dropped me off at my flat, my neighbour came to ask me for toilet paper, and we had a chat. It lead to us having a drink together to celebrate his new job opportunity as he hasn't had one in over two months, which in any circumstance I would be happy for anyone and would drink to it. But that's how I think he lures me, and once he has me talking I feel paralysed to move or get out of the situation. He offered me another drink and I said, \"No I don't want another because I have to drink my meds and go to bed,\" but he insisted. This is on a Monday night around 10pm and we both have stuff to do on Tuesday (which it is already because it's 5am, ugh). I never drink during the week. I refused once more, and the third time I caved in. We had a nice chat about his work and his new friend and about the custody battle with his ex wife for his son, all while listening to music. He came to sit next to me on the couch and after a while started complimenting me and saying how he would have sex with me if I wasn't in a relationship. I was already a bit tipsy, and one thing you should know about me, is that I don't judge easily. I take people for what they are and I appreciate it when they're honest and just themselves. But this... I don't know. He confessed to me how his typical type is brunettes (I'm a brunette), and we went down a whole YouTube music rabbit hole of songs we like. In the end, he gave me two kisses on the cheek and he caressed my hair. I felt frozen in my seat and didn't know what to say or do, but he just kept saying \"I'm just stirring the pot, don't worry. I won't do anything to you, you know that right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He also asked questions like, \"How far would your friends and boyfriend go to look for you if you were, for example, kidnapped?\" but he promised he was joking. There are multiple other things he did, he pointed to my private parts and said that women have control over men. He even 'accidentally' touched my boob as he was pretty tipsy, and he apologised. Ugh I feel so stupid typing this.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of it all, I sent my friend a message literally saying HELP, even though I knew my own flat was a few meters away. I literally felt so helpless and paralysed (though I wasn't spiked), and I feel so stupid and guilty for staying seated on that couch and not standing up for myself or setting the boundaries I know I usually would. I don't have any feelings for him whatsoever, just in case you're wondering.\n",
      "\n",
      "But yeah, I know I kind of put myself in that situation by accepting a drink from him in the first place. I got out of his house after 1:30, and I've been awake since just trying to process what the hell just happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't know how to feel about it. He's generally outgoing, friendly, open and honest about everything, and like I said, I appreciate it when people are like that. But I realised tonight that there's a limit to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So AITAH for thinking he might be grooming me, or am I over thinking? Please advise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back story. I (29F) am engaged to R (29M) we have been together for several years, own a home together and have a 10 month old baby. I see a therapist because my postpartum hit really bad, I gained weight during pregnancy I‚Äôm still struggling to lose and I shut him out intimately because of my insecurities in myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "One her tasks for us to reconnect physically and for me to get in touch with my sexual side again, was that any time R initiated, I should embrace it and say yes (unless of course I am truly having a bad moment) instead of turning him down because I am insecure in myself physically. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, he has consistently initiated sex daily since I talked to him about her homework for me a month ago and I have not once said no, despite my insecurities and my wanting to say no at times due to just not being in the mood with raising a baby and being tired. Nothing against R, I love him and he isn‚Äôt pressuring me whatsoever, but this has been hard for me in my postpartum. After consistently saying yes I will say my insecurities about being intimate have lessened significantly and last night I actually was really excited I was in the mood. I went to initiate with R, who said no. He wanted to go to bed early. \n",
      "\n",
      "I understand being tired, but I feel like this was a huge blow to my self esteem and I realize I‚Äôm being a jerk about it but now my immediate reaction is wanting to say no the next time he initiates sex because he said no to me after all the work I‚Äôve put into trying to reconnect and trying to say yes. I‚Äôm really hurt and don‚Äôt see my therapist until Friday so, Reddit. Give me my reality check. WIBTAH if I said no?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit to add: my therapist definitely wasn‚Äôt like oh go have sex even if you don‚Äôt want to. But she wanted me to really think about why I was saying no, was it because I didn‚Äôt want to have sex or was it because I was insecure about my body post baby etc and if my reason for wanting to say no wasn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt want to have sex it didn‚Äôt feel like having sex, it was for fear of x y or z I should try to say yes. And honestly it has worked a lot. I built up like a body phobia post baby because my body changed so much and I was terrified to even be naked in front of my partner let alone have sex which I did want to do, but fear stopped me. so this has definitely helped and I didn‚Äôt feel pressured to have sex. I want to have sex y‚Äôall lol. I would have said no within this last month if I truly didn‚Äôt want to. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, in this current day and age, this title would suggest ‚Äúyes‚Äù but please read for context. As the title implies, this isn‚Äôt so much about me, but rather someone I know (ISTA=Is She The A-Hole?).\n",

      "I am a bisexual male (26M) and my mom (57F) is on the more conservative side than me in terms of politics. However, she is very loving and accepting of my identity and doesn‚Äôt care which sex I date as long as they care for me and have my best interests at heart. When it comes to transgender issues, she‚Äôs a bit more out of touch but knows that I‚Äôve had trans friends in the past and would love them as if they were her own children.\n",
      "\n",

      "So my family and I flew up to a big city on the US east coast this past weekend to celebrate my masters graduation. It was a blast! Then after the ceremony we went to the university bookstore to shop for a few things before we hit the road back home. My sister (27F) had to go to the restroom to wash her hands so she went and we continued shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she came back, she had this puzzled look on her face and said, ‚ÄúWhen I went to the sink, there was this person standing behind me with a smug look. When I started leaving, they just let out an obnoxious ‚ÄòMMM-HMMM!!‚Äô It was so weird.‚Äù I asked her what they looked like and to sum it up, she said they looked like that person who dressed as Nicki Minaj in Bart Baker‚Äôs ‚ÄúSuper Bass‚Äù parody (shoutout to those old enough to remember THAT weird side of YouTube üòÇ).\n",

      "Full disclosure, I don‚Äôt want to rag on any of my transgender friends who are not considered *passing*; I personally believe everyone molds into their true gender expression at their own pace.

      "About 15 minutes later, my mom had to go to the bathroom and my sis went with her. When they entered, they saw that same person my sister described staring intently at the closed stall in front of them (even though there were two other open stalls available). There were two other women in there at the time: one was in her late-20s/early-30s hiding in the closed stall (we‚Äôll call her SL=scared lady), the other was a short-haired tattooed woman with lesbian flag earrings (so most likely lesbian) who was washing her hands and was clearly uncomfortable with what was happening (we‚Äôll call her NL=nice lesbian).\n",

      "After my mom and sis told me the story, I honestly thought that on one hand it‚Äôs good they caught someone being creepy and using their T-card to get away with it. But on the other hand, maybe she should‚Äôve dealt with the situation with more grace. Ever since the whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt say gay‚Äù controversy, there‚Äôve been a lot of stories of Karens throwing innocent trans people (and even cis people who may come across as trans because ‚Äúthey always know‚Äù) out of bathrooms and it just give me bad vibes knowing if something like this happens again then my mom would end up in one of those stories. But I also know my mom well; even though she doesn‚Äôt always understand LGBTQ+ culture, she‚Äôs a naturally kind and loving person.

      "We've (M37, F33) been married for 11 years. He has always wanted to work independently (he has no career, but works in construction) because he's not comfortable in office jobs, and frankly he's not good at it either. He never quit any job, but he did not particularly enjoy working, arguing that pay was too low. He always said to me that if I let him work independently, he'd be happier, and would earn more money. When the last company he worked for shut down, I finally got tired of \"forcing\" him to work office jobs, and told him that he could do whatever he wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to mention that when we met, we were contributing 50-50, then I grew in my career and he didn't, so it became 75-25 (by his request, obviously). Two years ago, when he had his last job, he said he could only contribute with basic services (while I pay the mortgage, vacations, and a part of food). In these 2 years, he had his share of small projects, but his money eventually ran out, and last month he told me he can't contribute anything anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know starting a business takes time, but he just doesn't seem any good at it. He does not know how to look for clients. He's slow. He's a bad organizer. He's bad with people. The only thing he's good at, is at manual things. In the course of all these years he gradually bought tools for carpentry, and has made furniture, but it just does not sell... all the clients he has had are my friends or my family. In 2 years he did not have any independent client. I'm just so tired of helping him... first to find jobs, now to find clients and closing the deals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last time (about a month ago) he told me he cannot contribute ANYTHING anymore because he's trying to grow his business, I blew up at him and told him to get a normal job because clearly his little venture is not working. He behaved like a little child, blaming me for not supporting him, and telling me that these things take time. Maybe he's right in one thing, I have friends who are architects, and they work independently, but I think that if you fail basic adulting, there's no fkn way you could start a business.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also acted very resentful because sometimes I take trips alone, and buy nice and expensive stuff for myself, while, in his words \"he doesn't even have money for a new pair of shoes\", but I don't feel bad at all because I earned my money, and I get to spend it how I want. I've also invited him to many vacations (I don't always go alone), but obviously I don't buy him clothes, and the food I buy is sometimes only enough for me. I know some of you would say that's shitty, but what am I supposed to do? Support a healthy grown man who took bad decisions?\n",

      "Setting aside finances, we're very compatible, love and are attracted to each other. He has no vices, not a drunk, no drugs. Is faithful. Likes spending time with family. He does a lot of stuff in the house, and I don't have to do anything for him (cook, wash clothes, all of it he does by himself and sometimes for me) but it seems like money is just something that makes us both awful to each other. I could make a massive effort and cope with the fact that he'll always be a financial dead weight, but it just seems like this is becoming worse than everything good in our 15 (11 married and 4 relationship) years of knowing each other.\n",

      "* With respect to the house chores, on a typical week the only thing I really do is cook 1 meal a day, like 2-3 times a week. He offered to cook more, but I'm honestly a better cook, and when I do cook, I always make enough for the 2 of us. He makes breakfast and dinner for me, but I don't eat much, so breakfast and dinners are very basic (I'll ask him to make me a sandwich, or a salad). I haven't mopped a floor in 5 years, he does all that. The thing is, we live in a big house, but since we're only 2 people with no pets, it just doesn't get dirty. I bought a large house for when things were better, and we were going to have kids (he really wants kids). If we get a divorce, I'm probably moving somewhere smaller. Outside the house keeping, he does literally everything (house maintenance, drives me everywhere, takes me to doctor appointments, takes care of me when I'm sick). When he's hungry and I'm not, he cooks for himself, and cleans afterwards (with a time lag, but he does eventually clean). Dishes sometimes stay until night, but he does wash them at night (mine and his). He's not a great housekeeper, but he does his best.\n",
      "* Like I said, I don't eat much, so sometimes I buy quality food in small portions, and he does not touch them because the portions I buy wouldn't be filling for him anyway. We just have different eating habits, that's what I meant with respect to food.\n",

      "I am looking for some advice because I have no idea what to do at this point. As the title suggests, I am having problems with my partner about gender. For context, I (22 AFAB nonbinary use they/them pronouns) and my partner (23M) have been together for over 2 years (at the time of writing) and we have a lovely baby boy (6 months). Recently we have been fighting about how he \"doesn't believe\" in the idea that your pronouns can be anything more than a descriptor of your binary sex (XX=female=she/her and XY=male=he/him). He thinks that just because HE doesn't believe in the idea that people can use different pronouns than ones that describe your binary sex that he just doesn't need to use someone's PREFERED pronouns when asked. I find this to be very disrespectful because I don't feel like it's too much to ask that someone not call me \"she/her\" and instead call me \"they/them\" out of plain respect (because somehow it makes that much of a difference). He's expressed that because he doesn't believe in this idea that he's taken it upon himself to do this for everyone (look at them, determine if they are biologically male or female, and only use pronouns depending on their answer even if they have explicitly asked him to use different ones). He says it's not out of disrespect because \"you cant force someone to agree with your belief if they don't want to\". He's also expressed that \"if it can't be backed by science, then it doesn't count\" (basically saying that if a scientist can't factually prove that being trans isn't a mental disorder that he can judge them based on chromosomes alone and that is enough (seriously, his (paraphrased) words, not mine)). We've gone back and forth about it so much that I can't talk about anything regarding LGBT things with him and I'm worried about when he finds out someone I am close to is trans because I know he's just gonna misgender them. Now, I understand that being trans is already a hot button topic for most nowadays, but I genuinely thought it wouldn't get to this point. I've made the argument that you wouldn't go up to a religious person as an atheist and tell them that because YOU don't believe in the idea of religion, that God isn't real or that they are inherently wrong for having that belief. Example: you wouldn't go up to a Jew (as an atheist) and tell them that God isn't real, there is no Messiah, and generally telling them that because YOU don't believe in Judaism that it isn't real. You would respectfully say that you don't believe in that (or any) religion but be respectful of their belief.

      "After Omegle died yesterday I've felt the need to address this. So for almost 3 years, ever since I was 15, I would go on Omegle (the chat only section) to sext with people and talk about doing things with them. I would use tags like \"thighs\" and \"tittyfucking\" that garnered towards my slightly niche fetishes. I would only chat with people my age or older, even sometimes lying about my age because I was so desperate to find someone who I reciprocated with, usually a girl despite the fact that i'm bi. Which still feels weird to me. I don't know why I did that. I remember I even did it while I was in a short but important relationship, even if it was an online friend from instagram. The guilt never left me from that and after my partner at the time disappeared for a while, it only got worse. But despite the guilt, I just KEPT doing it. Going on Omegle. And I feel like every time I did from then on, something bad would happen in my life. It's likely just superstition, but I do believe in karma, so I'm wondering if life was punishing me for doing that stuff on Omegle, even after my relationship and while I was single.\n",

However, after 15 minutes I realised I was hungry and asked my partner if they could make me a wrap with four toppings. It was also their turn to cook dinner, which was mutually agreed.\n",

      "  Over this last two months my husband has been pounding it in my head about saving money and paying off debt. I've been stressing over buying our kids clothes and shoes because I can't do that and buy enough groceries for the next two weeks on his strict budget.  So I've been picking up things little by little.\n",
      " Every fall I buy him three pairs of shoes.   A slip on shoe to play in like off brand crocs, a pair of boots for when it's cold, and a tennis shoe for daily school wear. I get everything in neutral colors because they need to match everything he wears.  Think brown black and grey.  Well he needed boots, so I got those for him last Thursday. I told my husband I would get him a pair of tennis shoes next check, but if he didn't want to wear his boots to school he could wear his crocs to school.  We live in the south, all the kids wear crocs. \n",
      " Today he was supposed to take our sons to the library and the park, so I could do some much needed house work. We'll when he came home he had a shoe store bag in his hand. I said \"you bought him some shoes?\" He looked sheepish and went into telling me he never got to pick out his own shoes as a kid, so he let our son pick out his own shoes.  Which was a dishonest representation of what happened. The shoes HE showed our kid was bright neon yellow and blue.  I already had a pair of the same shoes in my cart online,  but in black.  But, of course because dad is the coolest person ever and he liked those shoes,  our kid said he liked them too.\n",
      " Now I'm laying in bed seething because nothing I've bought him in the last two months matches those shoes,  and if I take them back I'm going to break my kid's heart.  I'm sick to my stomach.  My husband thinks I'm being an asshole and made me sound crazy because they are \"just shoes\" \"it doesn't matter if they match\", but it does,  because if he looks a mess, it's ME that looks bad. Not my son,  not my husband,  me. Now my husband is making me look like a bad mom because it's another thing that makes me look like I don't have my life in order.  Am I the asshole for being so angry? \n",

They would all complain about how teachers (of all genders) would write them up because they are sexulizing them, but that wasn't the case. These girls are the ones who would wear really inappropriate outfits to school every day. Don't get me wrong I don't think it gives anyone the right to cat call them or anything like that and I think it's ok to dress how you want but there is a line and a limit and I think a lot of girls in my generation cross it and when they get in trouble/dress coded they blame everyone else and want to file lawsuits against who ever said something (even if it was a harmless complement that had nothing to do with what they're wearing) feels like the girls in my generation who dress like this have no modesty.\n",

      "I (20f) have been dating my girlfriend (22f) for the past 6 months, and I did something with my guy bestfriend (21m) that was so confusing and I dont know what to do. My girlfriend and I met in college and I'm happy with us. This semester I took an internship closer to home and moved into an apartment with my guy best friend from high school, we will call him Cole.\n",
      "My girlfriend and I have great chemistry, better than either of us have ever had with anyone else, so we decided to try long distance because it is worth it. She felt a little uneasy at first about me living with my guy best friend (there is also another roomate but he is irrelevant to this situation), but she agreed that it made the most sense and it was economical and I have my own room. I wasn't too worried because if anything we are like siblings, and he knows I'm gay.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few nights ago I went out drinking with some friends from high school who I hadn't seen in a while, these weren't friends of Coles so he didn't want to come (long irrelevant story). I had a great time and got very drunk, and at the end of the night I got an uber back to the apartment. It was late when I came though the door, but Cole was still up waiting to make sure I got back safe.\n",

      "But as a few weeks went on my mental health declined and I shut everyone out. I didn't feel like I could trust anyone or feel safe. That's when I met my current girlfriend. She saw straight through me in a way no one had ever. I had never felt so comfortable around someone as her. We started out as friends, but developed into something more. We both needed someone like the other in out lives at that moment. Feeling safe around someone really helped me open back up to the people around me. I reached out to Cole, but it was still so challenging for me to talk to even him and feel comfortable. I told him what I was feeling and he was understanding as ever. Our relationship slowly crawled back in the direction of what it had been over the past few months, but that kind of intimacy with a non romantic partner still scared me. \n",

When I think back to remember this, thats when they stop feeling like my memories, and I start to feel like an observer with no understanding of what my brain was doing and barely a sense of what I was feeling. \n",
      "I asked Cole if he would cuddle with me that night (we had used to do this in the past when one of us was struggling). Even thinking about that now makes me wince, that's just not something I'm remotely comfortable with since last semester. He agreed and after we got into bed, I started to run my hands over him. At first like a massage, but then something that was overtly sexual. \n",

I also want to also be clear that I was initiating everything, he was just lying there. That's even more confusing to me. He was very much into it though. I asked him if he wanted it and he said he did. I kissed him, then we started to make out. I took off his shirt and also mine. It was passionate like a movie, but I don't remember feeling anything at all in the moment. I don't know why I kept going. Just numb. I vaugly remember trying to initiate something more, but he stopped me and asked me if I really wanted it. I said I did. I don't know why I said that\n",

We had been trying for kids and this was a very, very wanted baby. I cannot stress this enough. We had not even told anyone she was pregnant. We had just had the first doctor's appointment and we were going to tell people when the miscarriage happened. It was doubly hard because my brother was about to get married. He got married a week ago. I was in his wedding party and he had also asked me and our other brother to be co-master of ceremonies at the reception. I was going to make an excuse to get out of it because I felt like I should be focusing on my wife. However she said I should keep going because it was important to my brother and the wedding was only one day.\n",

She said she was thinking about it and she asked me to tell my family at the wedding because 1) she was tired of having to tell people and 2) my entire family would be in one place so I could announce it once and be done. TO BE CLEAR: MY WIFE ASKED ME TO DO THIS. I WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE IT WITHOUT HER TELLING ME IT WAS WHAT SHE WANTED. When we decided to tell people about the miscarriage I suggested we do it over messaging or email however my wife thought it was not personal enough. The miscarriage affected both of us. It was especially hard on my wife.\n",

However my brother and his wife we mad. She doesn't have a big family, only about 4 people and most of the people there were my family or friends of my brother that I knew too.

In fact, attending Miss Battleaxe‚Äôs wedding was something the group had been waiting to tick off on our bucket list for months.

Thinking back to it, I had always noticed Battleaxe was the first to offer Soggington a lift home.

I decided to spend my 2 weeks before moving to London seeing my college friends that I wouldn't see again for years and Colombia because it was cheaper than living in NYC in the meantime. He said that I didn't spend enough time investing in our family and I didn't visit enough when living in NYC (they live in the Baltimore Area). I know he personally doesn't  care about any of this, because it only came out when he spoke to my mom, not when I originally called him.\n",

A year later we were having a heart to heart and I told them that my partner back then was abusing me.

      "I, 34 Male and my fianc√© Aaron 30 male are planning our wedding. A little background my fiance moved to from California to Pennsylvania for my job. His whole family lives in California. When it was his birthday we took a trip to Washington DC with friends and proposed. I told him we can have the wedding in California since he moved cross country for me to show my appreciation of uim. Plus, his whole family is there and my family loves an excuse to travel. Win win for everyone and he was appreciative and happy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " We communicated our wants for the wedding and compromising with each other Planning has been easy on our end because we agree on nearly everything. We decide that both sides will have 3 groomsmen and 3 groom maids to keep it balanced.  The grooms in a tux and maids in a dress. We told our wedding party about the attire and said we would pay for the tux and dresses. They just have to get fitted and pick the maids puck the dress in the appropriate color my fiance and I will pay. Just to preface this next bit. Aaron and I are gay males, and our wedding party has lesbians, gay men, non-binary individuals, female identifying, etc. The whole alphabet mafia is represented. The whole wedding party knows how we want the wedding aesthetic and agrees on the attire except my fiances friend will call him Matt. Matt identifies as male. He calls himself a male, but he only wears women's clothing. He wears women's clothes with a full beard and mustache. Matt said he doesn't want to wear a tux because he feels uncomfortable in male clothes and wants to wear a dress. My fiance explained to Matt that everyone agreed to wear their respective gender attire. My fiance understood Matt's feelings and didn't want to invalidate them but told Matt that he has to realize that this is our wedding and \"my fianc√© wants a certain aesthetic since he comprised and a lot of things for the wedding\" Matt told my fiance that \"it's Aaron's wedding too.\" For my Fianc√© to say,\" and it's his\" Matt blew up on my fiance over the dress. \n",
      "\n",
      "My fiance and I had a discussion over it. His stance was he didn't care as much about  Matt wearing a dress but will support my decision. I explained to my fiance that with the ceremony, pictures and videography that the attention would be focus on Matt because he's a male in a dress with a full beard. The focus should be on us and not Matt. I also said that my grooms maid Maya is a lesbian, who wears men's clothing only said she will wear a dress since it's our wedding. Others in the wedding party also happily agreed to the traditional male and female attire. My fiance started to see my side. He asked for advice from his family, friends, and co-workers and they all stated that the wedding is about  Matt should just wear the suit it's just for 1 day. My fiance is stressed over this, I told him that Matt only has to wear the tux for the wedding ceremony and the picture following right after. When both are done he can change into a dress or he can be invited as a guest and wear a dress. The photographer can take picture with just them separately. My fiance agreed that it's was a reasonable compromise. He then ask others if it was reasonable his friends, family, co-workers thought it was a good idea.  My fiance went to talk to Matt again and told him the compromises, Matt got upset and said no he doesn't want to be forced to wear the tux. They argue again. Matt saying that \"I don't like him and that I'm against him wearing the dress and it's my fiances wedding too.\" My fiance basically gave up and I told him that I will talk to Matt but my fiance is apprehensive. My Fiance said he will talk to Matt but he has let it drag out for 3 months. They still talk nearly every day but avoid this topic. I'm not pressed on time for the wedding but I don't like it up in limbo. I'm ready to uninivite Matt but I know my fiance wants him there, so I won't. AITAH for not letting Matt wear a dress to for the wedding?\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: I need to clarify a little. Matt was never supposed to be in the wedding. My fiance's 3 brothers were supposed to be the groomsmen. This is why we choose 3 groomsmen and maids on each side. One of my groomsmen wears dresses and  makeup, but I asked if he would be ok to wear a tux and agreed. He didn't bat an eye at it. Maya said \" it's our day and agreed to wear a dress.\"   Everyone on in the wedding party was told what the attire would be and if they were ok with it. Everyone agreed. When Matt found out my fiance's brother had dropped out, Matt interjected himself in. My fiance told him the aesthetic, and he's the only one who had an issue. I'm paying for the tuxes and dresses.  Matt can wear a tux for the ceremony and photos, which would take about 2 hours. Then, during the reception, he can wear a dress and have his own photoshoot with my fiance. The 2nd option is Matt can come as a guest and wear a dress.  Matt was never asked to be part of the wedding he invited himself.\n",

      "I (40 f) have been with my fianc√© (48 m), I‚Äôll refer to him as J, for 6 years. His son (18 m) -K-  moved in with us about 4 years ago.  It was a struggle to get K to graduate.  His mother (42 f) was extremely strict, and my fianc√© has a lot of guilt about everything he allowed when they were together, as well as, how things were handled when he left.  Visitation was limited and awful. When his son came to live with us J let everything with K slide.  Missing homework, missing school, all the while knowing he was smoking weed.  We both smoke weed, and have very open and honest relationships with our kids about it, we expect honesty in return, but there are boundaries.  This isn‚Äôt a free for all. No matter how hard I try to support K, and set boundaries, I don‚Äôt feel like J supports me.  At times I even call him Prince K because I feel like no matter how disrespectful he can be towards me J still makes excuses.  Maybe I‚Äôm making excuses for J because he plays that guilty dad card, but I‚Äôm so fed up.  J and I recently bought a HUGE house.  We agreed that K would pay rent to live there and would have the freedom of an adult if he was working.  side note : it was an entire year of struggles to get K to get a part time job when he turned 16.  He was 17 before he finally made any effort despite me bringing it up all the time.  After K graduated, barely, I think he turned in his last assignments the day of his graduation party, 2 days before he was thankfully allowed to walk, he quit his part time job with no notice to go work for a family friend, doing manual labor.   I‚Äôm sorry but this is appalling to me.  All of it. I was raised that education is everything. Striving for excellence, and giving your best. I don‚Äôt even understand having to push anyone to want to get a job because I have my own kids and my son (20 m) and my daughter (15 f) couldn‚Äôt wait to get a job so they could have their own money.  There was a miscommunication about when K would be paid, so on the final day he was supposed to work, he ignored his bosses calls and texts all morning and waited until after 5pm to text our family friend that he wasn‚Äôt coming back to work until he got paid.  He was obviously fired.  How completely embarrassing!!!! J chose the road that it was none of his business and he wasn‚Äôt involved. Separate business and personal.  Well since K pulled that crap over a month  ago he hasn‚Äôt worked and has made little to no effort with every excuse in the book as to why he hasn‚Äôt gotten a job. I encourage him every day and ofer to help, giving him places to apply because literally 20+ places are hiring in our area. Absolutely no effort.  Refused to apply to anything but online. Doesn‚Äôt follow up. Finally I had enough. I told J to take K‚Äôs PlayStation controller bc he needed a fire kit under his butt.  That child came out raging.  Insanely disrespectful about how he is an adult that pays rent (2 weeks ago I finally for the first time made him pay $500 dollars.)  He has never paid for his cell phone or car insurance.  He literally plays his play station for most of the day, getting high.  He argued that it was completely inappropriate for us to take his property (a $350 scuff controller that we gave him for Christmas) because he is an adult.  I told him I agree I shouldn‚Äôt have to go to these lengths for him to pull his head out of his butt.  I thought we made a break through.  He seemed to understand the expectations.  Then today, absolutely nothing changed. He never left the house. He has stepped up his cleaning and helping around the house and while I told him appreciate it Inalso don‚Äôt want him to be my maid.  I want him to get a freaking job. AITAH?????\n",

He isn't the violent type despite being a bigger guy (he goes to the gym a lot but says he would get his ass kicked in a real fight because he's never been in one), but he is however very charming and clever uses that aggressively against people he doesn't like.

Evan will easily win them over, gets them hyped up and then offers to buy shots. I've never seen anyone turn it down. He then take them to the bar and will order so many shots that they're falling over drunk and at serious risk of hurting themselves. Like, I've seen this entire process play out in as little as 5 minutes. \n",

Then they'll proceed to do like 4 double shots, the guys get completely wasted and Mike waits a few minutes and calls the bouncer over to throw them out. I'm not at the bar with them when this is happening so I never knew how much they were actually drinking.\n",

Evan disagrees and says that this is far better than confrontation or escalation which could easily turn violent and that he never forced anything on anyone as they're all 'consenting adults.' He brings up they were the initial aggressor and that it's odd that I'm defending people hostile to him/us. I just think he takes it too far, and for what?

      "Basically, my friend told me these girls liked me I sent a photo to him and he sent it to her then he made a GC with them so I send a couple photos and they start arguing after that we do a video call they start to be really rude so at that point I lost all interest in them so I leftcalll because I was pissed I then rejoined to see what they would say one of them started to say it was because of my WiFi and said I had bad WiFi this isn't a big deal right? well it wasn't really but I wanted to prove her wrong at least so I sent my connection speed and proof I was at 5 lines thing. Then they start to call me geeky after that which annoys me even more so after a little while one of them asks me I unsurprisingly say no she then gets angry and tells J (someone else my friend added) J then starts sending me death threats and threatened to find out where I live I toldJ J I had a VPN so I was good J starts calling me geeky again which I was so annoyed I didn't care after alot of threats I do just to get them to stop. Next day I woke up even more angrier and filled with rage at that point I was so angry that I ghosted all of them (even the girl) Worth mentioning that we couldn't have a interaction because she gave a response that makes no sense most of the time. J sends me more death threats but stops eventually after realizing I wouldn't date her she's now saying I'm rude. Any thoughts on this AITA?\n",

      "The title sounds bad but here‚Äôs some back story. I was in a relationship for 9 months and at the start it was amazing. honeymoon phase if you want to say. However before that i was talking to a guy, lets call him Ethan for this sake. Ethan and i used to talk and there was always a bit of spark. We stopped talking as we went different ways. my then boyfriend who is now my ex, lets call him Josh, knew about ethan and always had a dislike toward him. mind you me and ethan were not talking whatsoever through our relationship. josh would always accuse me of talking to ethan even tho ethan was blocked on all social media platforms. that was really the only thing we argued about. 4 months into me and josh‚Äôs relationship i went through his phone to send myself a photo that he took on his phone. i didnt mean to snoop but when i did my heart dropped. he was talking to another girl, flirting, saying he wanted her and not me. i was heartbroken. i confronted him and he said it was his friend on his account but by the way it sounded whilst his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù was talking to her. it sounded like how he flirted with me. exactly the same, after that huge arguement i ended up letting it go and believing him. after that argument he never let me touch his phone. EVER. if i was handing it to him he would get frustrated saying ‚Äúdont touch my phone you know how i feel about that‚Äù , suspicious i know. a couple weeks go by and i see that same girl on his phone talking to him. now i didnt snoop and i dont know for sure if they were talking but i had enough. i messaged ethan asking to hang out and one thing led to another (you kinda have to imagine that part) i broke up with josh 2 weeks after seeing ethan. josh was obsessed w me to the point he‚Äôd call me all hours of the night begging to talk to me. i blocked him on everything, he made an account on instagram and messaged me saying he wanted to talk. i said to him, and i quote, ‚Äúim sorry for telling you this but i need space and i dont want you to constantly be messaging me. i cheated on you with ethan. if you wouldnt mind i need space‚Äù then it went downhill. he called me every name under the sun. you think of any name i guarantee you he called me it. he said he was going to kill me for doing that to him so again i blocked him. im sorry if that doesnt make sense i just need an outsiders opinion on if im the asshole. so aita? \n",

We do still talk on a regular basis, and our kids hang-out here and there. Her sons are 7 and 3 and my son is 10. She asked me to be a bridesmaid about 8 months ago, and of course I excitedly agreed!

I realized a few weeks ago that my kid wasn't included in the RSVP count/number of guests we received by mail. No kid wedding, and this was on her website that was never really given out or talked about, apparently. I tried to have the discussion with her about the fact that the wedding is on a Wednesday, and I have my child with me as there's no one available for childcare. Not to mention, my kid has assumed they were coming to the wedding too, especially after they hung out with her sons as they are going to be there (and a select few other children will be there as well). She basically won't budge on this, and isn't letting my child come.\n",

My dad is the one so adamant about this, as he feels bad for my kid being excluded and knowing full well what is going on at their age. I don't want to ruin my parent's night though, nor do I want to cause any drama or all of these changes. I just feel feel personally, that the least my friend could have done was squeeze an extra chair in and help me out given the circumstances. My partner is willing to leave with our child if need be after cocktail hour (he's an introvert and would rather be out with our kid having fun then socializing with strangers lol). But my parents really don't mind not staying for the entirety and are pushing for that. They haven't shared this news to her yet, but I'm anticipating some gossip and drama already.

I stopped relapsing in fruit ninja on my limbs, and the sewerslide thoughts calmed a bit. I'm getting outside more and enjoying life, with a new perspective. Ofc, I still have those piss poor days, where I want to pass away, I'm human. That's 2/7 days every week.  I guess you could say I'm becoming more \"spiritual\" as I'm analyzing and working on myself, connecting with people around me, and realizing we are all just humans. I've quite literally grown into a better version of me. I stopped lashing as much, anxious style turned somewhat into a secure one. I pretty much stopped tweekin over little stuff.\n",

I understand we made promises to each other about a future, but I can't build my world with someone who is constantly triggering me, and is nowhere near healed, when I haven't even fully healed myself. Yes, you should take the good and bad parts of your partner, but when it's more than always bad, and it's constantly harming you, leaving you confused, and feeling unloved, I think it's okay to make that statement.

Anyway when I was younger my mom always made fun of me being overweight when at her house. At the time my dads house was the only place I felt safe from her, mind you my brother now (18 m) was bigger than me yet that was her sweet little baby. Now to the asshole part, the past few months my mother has been making me feel really insecure about my weight and looks. So I had started to eat better and meal prep, I had also started to do at home exercises. While my mother was doing the opposite. After she gave birth to my younger siblings she let herself go down the drain. She still took care of herself but she had gained at least 15-20 pounds. Mind you she still called me fat. The past few days she wouldn‚Äôt stop making remarks on how I look yet in the past 5 months I‚Äôve lost 16 pounds and am a lot happier. So yesterday I made a loaf of pumpkin bread because my brother wanted some. After it was done I had a single slice and my mom make a fat joke at me. Today I asked if there was any left because my brother texted me and asked if there was so I asked my mom. She started to say how I need to eat less and all of these things about my weight. I had been so fed up with it I said something about how she‚Äôs the one feeding her kids McDonald‚Äôs every other day. So she started to say how I‚Äôm being bitchy then stopped talking. Later she went on about my weight again and I exploded on her saying how I‚Äôm not the fat one here she is and how she needs to take her own advice. She acted like a child and stormed off.

I had a plan to get him his own place within a year. Places where he will find work. Everything. She not only told me no, she said this is the last we're ever going to talk about it and I had to make a choice. When she put it that way, it was easy. I always knew what I had to do, I was just lying to myself. If my grandma were here, and she called me and asked me to help him, I couldn't have said no, relationship be damned.

My oldest son, Mando (15M), My oldest daughter, Katarina (10F), My youngest son, Julian (5M), And my new baby girl, Melanie who is 3 weeks old. When Katarina was a baby, music always calmed her down, so I got her this music box. This was a rare and beautiful music box. The company that made it made other music box discs so you could change the music to whatever tune you wanted. The box was also beautiful, it had this very beautiful unique design on it, and had a Ballerina on the inside that would spin with the music. It was so gorgeous when I saw it, and I knew I just had to get it for Katarina. Katarina loved it, Whenever she cried, we would play the music for her, and she‚Äôd stop. When she got older and started to walk, she would twirl around with the music. As she grew up, she started playing with it less and less. She stopped playing with it around age seven. I thought it was just because she grew bored of the music, so I gave her new discs of music, but she always piled them up and never tried them out. Fast forward 3 years later, Me and my husband found out we were having another girl. We were overjoyed and started decorating her room. I felt that it was missing something though. I thought of Katarina‚Äôs music box. Another bit of context, Katarina was giving up some of her old toys and pillows she didn‚Äôt really use anymore. She was just as excited as we were because we were getting another girl. I thought that since she hadn‚Äôt used it in three years, she wouldn‚Äôt mind, so I took it from her room and put it in the babies room. A week passes. We show our kids the room since it‚Äôs fully finished. Katarina was happy until she wasn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúWhat is my music box doing here?‚Äù She said and looked at it. I told her I put it in the babies room since she didn‚Äôt use it anymore. She got mad. ‚ÄúWhy would you give my music box away?!‚Äù She screamed at me. I told her to calm down. She kept screaming at me. I got fed up with it. I shouted at her saying that she should be grateful I didn‚Äôt sell it. If she really loved and valued it, she would‚Äôve recognized it was gone a week ago.She could‚Äôve opened the music discs I gave her, and I wouldn‚Äôt have taken it. And that she was being over dramatic because she could see it anytime she wanted to. She stormed out of the room and went to hers. Because of my pregnancy hormones, I started crying when I heard the slam. My husband comforted me, Mando went to go console Katarina, and since Julian is only 5, and didn‚Äôt know why mommy and sissy were yelling at each other, he just cried with me. 3 days later, I go into labor. We go to the hospital and Melanie is born. Mando and Julian held her, but Katarina said she didn‚Äôt want to. I wasn‚Äôt gonna spoil the moment and call her out for being petty, so I didn‚Äôt say anything. Katarina still hasn‚Äôt talked to me, but I know she doesn‚Äôt hate Melanie. I know this, because every time I hear Melanie cry in the middle of the night, I hear Katarina go in her room, and play the music box until she calms down. She‚Äôs talked to my husband, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad about the music box. Melanie can have it if it makes her happy. But I‚Äôm still mad at mom for just giving it to her.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong, and neither does my husband or my son thinks so. What do you think? Am I the asshole?\n",

      "I started it off by apologizing. I told her I should‚Äôve asked her about the music box, and not just give it away because I thought she didn‚Äôt value it. I told her I still wanted Melanie to borrow the music box, but she could bring it back to her room whenever she wanted. And then I wanted her to tell me why she suddenly cared about the music box, after trying to give it away so many times.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then told me ‚ÄúI went through your phone gallery, a few days before the fight. I went through the photo album you have for me (I have a photo album for each of my kids). She was looking at the baby photos and videos my husband took of me and her when I first got her the music box. (The music discs I mention earlier? They were music box parodies of popular songs.) I would sing to her every time I played the music box. She said she remembered one of videos, it was when she was five. When Julian was first born, she was jealous because daddy and mommy were paying more attention to the baby then her. I took the video and laughed, telling her that she‚Äôll always be our little girl, then I sang her goodnight. She said she could care less about the music box, or the fact that I took it. She was upset because she didn‚Äôt want her mom to be that way with the new baby. She said it was like that one deleted scene from Mean Girls (I asked her why the hell she was watching Mean Girls and she said it‚Äôs ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù lol.) Where Regina is telling Cady in the bathroom, that she didn‚Äôt want to have her cousin to have her dollhouse, so she destroyed it. I told her she‚Äôll always be my first girl, but a new baby requires a lot of special attention. She said she understood and apologized for snapping at me. We got her favorite restaurant for dinner and when my husband agrees to take care of Melanie, we can spend the day together.\n",

They have a pool I don't mind going in and playing with her. On this day I wasn't feel very confident and had a chest binder on, she kept asking me to go into the pool I told her no that I wasn't feeling very well. She kept asking and begging trying to throw water on me, I had enough and told her off telling her she needs to learn boundaries, learn that no means no and she shouldn't beg she isn't an animal. If she had gotten me soaked I would have had to cut my chest binder off and I know for a fact that her or her parents wouldn't pay to replace it due to the brand i use being ¬£30-¬£45 before shipping. The reason I would have had to cut the chest binder is it would have gotten so tight on me making it very hard to breath.\n",

      "30F here and I've been talking to a guy (33) for about a week on Hinge. We've been messaging every day since we first matched and the chemistry over digital communication is there for sure. I made a joke 2 nights aho about why he hasn't asked for my number and he responded with that he was fine with exchanging numbers if we both felt we were ready, but he asked me if I could quickly verify myself on Hinge before he gave out his number. He wasn't pushy or anything and did not accuse me of anything that would make a person seem suspicious. The specific thing he said was: \"Can I be that guy to ask you to quickly verify before sending my number over? I'm all about that mutual safety for both of us and I don't want my personal number to fall into the wrong hands\". For the record, he is verified. \n",
      "\n",
      "Originally, I didn't think much of it because I thought I WAS verified by Hinge, but it turns out that when you change your pictures and no longer have a solo one, Hinge removes your verification. So I quickly re-verified and he sent me his number. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where I need judgement: While all this was going on, I texted a few of my friends asking if this was a weird situation any of them had ever been in. Almost all of my girls told me that this was unsettling behavior because verification is usually to protect other women on dating apps, not so much guys on dating apps because it is far more unsafe for women than men. They also said that if we've been talking for over a full week, this guy should know I'm legitimate and should trust me enough to give me his phone number. \n",

      "I've been thinking about it for the last 2 days and in the meantime, have not messaged this guy back. I don't fully agree with what my friends are saying in full, but I get the point they're driving at. He messaged me this morning saying \"Hey, I'm sorry if I said something wrong but I did not think asking for both of us to be verified before moving off Hinge would be a dealbreaker, but if it is, I hope you find what you're looking for on here.\" I'm starting to feel like I let my friends get in my head a bit because I've otherwise really enjoyed talking to this person. \n",

He will tell anyone who will listen about his comic books. But today was different. He was sad about his comic book. I ask why? And he said \"mom listen ok?\" I said ok and what he said next shuck me to my core. He said \"mom in this comic book there is no man h!tting a woman\" I was kinda shocked but I asked him \"what do you mean sweetheart?\" He looked me dead in the eye and said \"Mom you do know that a man will always have the power no matter what.\" I was stunned.  Me and his dad go a divorce just before i had my son. But we were still good friends. We kept walking until we got home. I tell him to go to bed and I will see him in the morning. Then I called his dad. He was discusted. He asked if I was ok and I said I was a little shocked but im ok. He then said \"Do you want me to come and collect him in the morning and he can stay with me for a few weeks?\" I agreed. I was so discusded. Who had taught him this.

I wished to give her a very positive experience, to the point that I even dressed specially for the occasion, Which included switching out my usual comfortable merchandised t-shirt out for a more formal Buttoned shirt. I will also refer to our mutual Heterosexual Male friend as Nick.\n",

This is factually inaccurate, as Of course I am attracted to a Woman, but she was outside of my usual type. I told her that I am Not very comfortable around Women who I am not close with. It is at this point that I mentioned that my Straight Male best friend brought me here a few weeks ago. My Date asked me when I found out I was \"queer\", and I responded that I was Heterosexual. She chuckled at this, which I was not too pleased with, but we continued the date.\n",

The date was not going well, but we continued as we have a mutual friend.\n",

Fast forward three days later my brother was going off to college and he wanted me to come to India to stay with him for a few days before he leaves. I love my brother and really wanted to go. We were a little tight on budget but even though we went back to our country (as in me (22) and my son). When N heard about this, she got excited because she thought I was there for her wedding.

I thought they might be busy with their studies. 2 hours after my delivery I was going through my WhatsApp when I saw the chats going on in our friend group. There was a picture of my newborn in the chats and I got really angry. I asked them where they got this picture from (I didn‚Äôt sound angry in the text, I was genuinely curious) and S(f23) apologetically (she always does that to make me look bad, but I never even once questioned it) told me that she was sorry and she got the picture from my husband‚Äôs instagram story. Right then I was seeing red and was super pissed at everybody. I was in pain after my delivery and was super sad for no specific reason. I got angry at my husband. I said in our friends group that I wanted to show them my baby‚Äôs picture because that‚Äôs what I wanted. By then I was crying because everyone took me off my happiness. The day after that I felt really bad and I thought that I was being hard on S for no reason. I tried calling S twice and even send her a audio recording me apologizing. But she didn‚Äôt reply or call me for even months after that. N on the other hand had no specific reason to not talk to me but that is what she did. She stood by S and didn‚Äôt talk to me for a long time. When one of my other friend (K) had a baby, they all went to see her. But they never came to see me or even called me. \n",

She said some things like \"it should not have a corset\" or \"I want it as clean as possible\" and I decided to gather some photos and make an album based on the dresses she tried out during the day and I forward some websites to wedding dress shops that I know of. Looking back I realized this was a mistake and I did apologize for it, because Rachel told me that I am being pushy and creating stress, by expressing my opinion on what dress she should wear, where all I did was create an album with similar dresses. Let's be clear here - I never told her what she should wear, just gave her ideas.   \n",

So this is what he did with Rachel's now husband / boyfriend at the time. Which apparently was not taken well and both Rachel and her husband got really upset about. However, I only discovered this later when me and Rachel had a phone conversation about everything (don't worry, I'll get there ;) ) But at the same time, Jack has always been like this and he does this to everyone, including to me and the rest of my friends.   \n",

My mistake was that I usually share and I shared this one with my future MIL, because she knew how excited I was about this wedding and she was the one helping me find a dress as well. I told Rachel that my future MIL reminded me that these glasses are usually engraved and asked if Rachel is planning to engrave them. So she started yelling at me for sharing things about her wedding with strangers and giving her advice on this. I apologized again and this was the last time I spoke about the wedding. \n",

I don't remember when it was, but we were just the two of us and I wanted to make sure that her back then boyfriend / now husband is the right choice for her, as I thought that this is a big decision and it should not be taken lightly. The thing is that so far, before the engagement the only impression I got from Rachel about her husband is that they are fighting constantly, that he is (her words, not mine) \"acting like a child\" and this relationship is not really worth it. So naturally when I understood that they are engaged, I was first extremely surprised and second wanted to make sure that all the problems they had are cleared up.

After the ceremony, each guest was invited to give the couple their gift and I waited to be one of the last ones, so I can tell her that despite the fact that she is angry still at me, I am sorry and hope to be her friend.

She also is taking D t America soon, I asked if I could come and her response was that I always go on holiday and that I'm being greedy.

      "Fast forward a few months later I decide to ask him why he got so annoyed at me that day. From his pov he thought I was the one being in appropriate as I was in his words \"thought policing\" him and \"not knowing my place\" as his son. From my perspective, watching my dad (a middle aged man) behave that way to a couple of young women (who looked a similar age to my 17f sister) was a very uncomfortable experience.

Like just cause you are a different race doesn't mean i need to give you the only 50 bucks in my account. Also, when people demand things that are over $1,000, it is just crazy.

      "This sounds bad but hear me out. So I (F 20) had a guy best friend who we will call K(M 20). K and I met online through video games. He and I followed each other on social media and after getting to know him and I introduced him to my close friends. K took a very strong liking to me. Nothing weird or creepy, in the beginning until K would non-stop flirt with me and compliment me. He then would be a bit more graphic about how much he liked me and go into extreme details. And he wouldn‚Äôt stop. He only knew what my face looked like and my voice. Eventually he said things like, ‚ÄúI wonder what you look like with your shirt off‚Äù. I asked him to stop, said I wasn‚Äôt interested multiple times but he never listened, and even expressed how uncomfortable I was. I wouldn‚Äôt reply to his texts anymore after that. My friends, who I introduced him to, took a liking to him and convinced me to forgive him. And I did. I told one of my best friends who didn‚Äôt really know K, we will call her N (F 20). I expressed to her how creeped out I was. When he continued with sexually explicit compliments I lied and said I had a bf. He was livid when I told him, he yelled at me and would begged me to be with him. But he was even more livid when he found out I was lying bc my other guy best friend B (M 18) told K that I was lying. I told N and she proposed that she pretends to be my gf so he will see how evident it is that I‚Äôm not interested. I was kinda hesitant at first but then agreed. I thought that when he knew I ‚Äúhad a gf‚Äù and that I liked girls it would put a stop to it but I was wrong. I was bi (now lesbian) at the time so I wasn‚Äôt acting like someone I wasn‚Äôt. He would send flirtatious messages (that I ignored and tried to change the subject) and N asked him to leave me alone and he became upset again and still made explicitly sexual comments abt me, even to her. A mutual friend N and I have said that I should just block him, I didn‚Äôt owe him anything and he never met me in person. I blocked him which caused him to make random accounts to message me abt how he was in love with me and how ‚Äúhe wants to hold me and see how beautiful I am when I sleep‚Äù. And how I shouldn‚Äôt have blocked him. I admitted to K that N and I weren‚Äôt a couple but that I truly wasn‚Äôt into him and tried everything to show him I just wanted to be friends and me telling him to stop just didn‚Äôt work so I lied. In a fit of rage he cussed me out on the phone and I hung up on him. He texted me again on the random accounts but I didn‚Äôt even reply, I blocked any accounts he made and he eventually left me alone. And I thought that was the end of it. I come to found out those 3 friends I introduced him to in the beginning, one including B, still talked on the game with him. No biggy though because it‚Äôs their lives and I won‚Äôt tell them who their friends are, until I found out he asked where we all live so he could find me and get closer to me. They became best friends so they told him the town we lived in and even offered to pick him up in his town. Later on I found out he only lives 2 hours from us, which is an awful coincidence. K and the 3 friends grew closer and arranged to bring him to our hometown to meet irl and hang out with him. They know why I blocked him and everything he has said to me but still want me to ‚Äúapologize for lying and give him another chance.‚Äù On top of that, they were mad at me for lying and saying it was messed up. They wanted to bring him to my house asking if I was home and wanted to meet him or go with them to the target parking lot they ended up hanging out at with him in the night. Of course I said no and was dumbfounded they would even ask. Luckily I was with N and our mutual friend at the time at N‚Äôs house. K wouldn‚Äôt stop harassing me so I felt that lying abt N and I being together would help. Apart of me feels bad and thinks I could‚Äôve handled it better but it feels like my plan worked. Does that make me an asshole?\n",

      "So, my now 32 year old daughter has a 9 year old daughter with a man that used to be very aggressive, controlling, possessive, and emotionally abusive. Just for a background, they had a custody battle 6 years ago when their daughter was about 3 years old after they broke up. He kept her for 2.5 months out of fear that my daughter would try to take her first. My family and I helped her secure a decent lawyer to get her daughter back. They have had a court order since then that gave my daughter primary custody and her father has standard visitations. \n",
      "However, during the year after the custody battle, my daughter and granddaughter had a traumatic experience with a man she was dating and she ended up reconnecting with her daughter's father. From what she told me, he was still emotionally abusive to her and controlling however, she remained with him. I will say that for the most part, he's a good father to their daughter and he is very protective of both of them, but I always felt that it was a toxic relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to 5 years later, 2021, and my daughter has claimed since 2019 that they are happy. They did couple's therapy and she claims they have worked hard to be together for their daughter and he has changed and that they are really happy. However, from what I remember, back before their custody battle, when they lived with me, they would get into very loud, aggressive arguments. They would throw things and punch holes in the wall. I haven't lived with them since then but I'm not convinced that things are as good as my daughter says. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, my son in law is a mechanic. He has often helped me and my daughter's brother with car problems either for free or in exchange for much cheaper than a shop would charge. When they've needed financial help, I've always helped with or without getting car work in return. \n",
      "So there was a time when I gave them an advance in return for car work. My son-in-law kept changing his mind about working on the car because he and my daughter claim I was being difficult about it and they were willing to just pay me back the money I had helped them with. I got emotional because I was upset I wouldn't get my car fixed. My granddaughter, 8 at the time, was also in their home when we were trying to figure out this car issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "My son-in-law and my daughter were arguing in their bedroom with the door cracked. They were pretty heated and my granddaughter looked kind of worried. They weren't really mad at each other but they were arguing about whether he should go ahead with fixing my car and I was crying in their living room over this. I was upset that he had changed his mind about my car even though they had offered to pay me back the money I had given them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I decided that their daughter and I didn't need to hear them arguing in the next room and I took my daughter's car keys and went out the door and my granddaughter ran out after me.  I told her that we're going to leave for a little while because her parents are arguing. I took my daughter's car and we started driving down to McDonald's. My daughter called me right as I pulled out of their apt complex, freaking out because I had taken her daughter in her car and did not even tell her and demanded that I bring her back. I was really upset about my car and I didn't think that my granddaughter needed to be subjected to hearing her parents arguing like that. I knew how their arguments used to get out of control, no matter how \"happy\" my daughter claims they have been or how she has claimed that they do not have intense arguments anymore in the past few years. So I started ignoring my daughter's calls and me and my granddaughter drove around a neighborhood nearby. My son(my daughter's brother) called me telling me that I need to bring my granddaughter back home after she couldn't get a hold of me. I called my daughter and told her that I had recorded their fight and that I am going to the police station with it and I'm not bringing their daughter back. Although I didn't actually record anything, I was just upset over the whole car situation and felt like my granddaughter deserved better then hearing their parents having an argument over fixing my car. \n",
      "My daughter texted me that if I didn't bring her back, that she would call the police and called my bluff on taking a recording to the police because she claims that they were only having a mildly heated discussion and the police would simply look at a recording of a closed door with two adults having a mild heated discussion in their own bedroom and there was absolutely no physical or emotional danger to their child.\n",
      "So I went ahead and started coming back with her daughter. Before I came back, I wanted to make sure that I would get the money that I paid them and the parts that I paid for so I could return the parts. My daughter assured me that my car was able to be driven and that she would pay me back immediately and that the parts and the receipt were in my car. She accused me of not actually caring about her daughter's welfare and this was just an act of revenge for my son-in-law not finishing the work on my car. And that if I actually had concern for her daughter, she would've called the cops herself or called CPS. Although I was upset about my car, I do feel that my granddaughter did not need to hear their argument. And I would never call CPS on my daughter to get her in trouble. I just decided that my daughter was still brainwashed by my son-in-law and that she was not making a good choice by allowing an argument to happen with her daughter in the home. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I brought my grand daughter back, the cops were there and I explained what happened. I also know my son-in-law owns a gun and I told the cops that as well. He owns the gun legally and has never used it for anything but protection and my daughter has never expressed fear over him having it, but I figured the cops should know. \n",
      "The cops explained that if there was actual concern for the child, that unless I can prove real danger and file for an emergency court order, I cannot take the child without permission and refuse to bring her back. Nobody got in trouble and I left. \n",
      "\n",
      "My daughter did not speak to me for months. After a few months though, even though I did not apologize for removing my granddaughter from her dysfunctional parents was wrong and I acted right in the moment, she said she would have lunch with me and bring my granddaughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, a year later, even though I get to see my granddaughter regularly, (at least 3-4 times a month), she still will not let my 9 year old granddaughter spend the night or otherwise spend time with me alone. She claims she cannot trust me and although she would never keep me from seeing my granddaughter at all, she is upset I never admitted wrong for thinking I had the right to refuse to bring her daughter back home that day, despite her and my son-in-law having a loud, heated discussion with their daughter in the next room. My daughter claims that I still think she's brainwashed by my abusive son-in-law and not able to make good judgements for her own child. \n",
      "I have helped my daughter financially a LOT in the past year and I don't think I should help anymore if I'm not even allowed to have unsupervised visits with my granddaughter. Although my daughter never guilts me into helping her and I often OFFER the help, I do it hoping that she will let go of what happened last year and allow me to see my granddaughter unsupervised again. But my daughter claims that even though I've said sorry, it wasn't genuine because I still bring it up and I'm only concerned about having her validate my feelings and I don't truly comprehend the damage I did when I refused to bring her daughter home that day.\n",

Lip fillers, a little botox, colored her hair, etcetera.  \n",

      "I (m), and my wife married at 19. We were each other's first. Three years into our marriage I cheated on my wife with the wife of another soldier while he was away at training. My wife found out because I left her locked out of our apartment during a hurricane type storm. She knew something was up immediately and I eventually confessed. I kept seeing the other woman for a while and when my wife gave me an ultimatum, an argument ensued, I picked her up and put her out of our apartment. I just REALLY wanted to keep the affair going and even felt a hatred towards my wife. She was pregnant and I told her she should just abort it. She eventually went home to her family to heal. Not too long after the woman I was having an affair with told me she was also pregnant. I realized what a stupid mistake I'd made and begged my wife to come back to me. Unfortunately, she told me she'd already had an abortion because she was afraid to raise a child alone and in a way tied to a man who didn't want her or the baby. Anyway, due to her culture, strong belief in God and honoring commitments as well as her vows, she forgave me and we moved on together. We have had some really great moments together, traveled a lot, had a daughter and generally have lived a decent life by most people's standards. When my daughter was about 11, I finally confessed everything that had happened in our marriage-- an entanglement with another woman, hitting on/telling her sister I loved her, going to a strip club while training, and other flirty type encounters that I'd had. Through it all she forgave me. Since then the only thing I have done is watch porn, which she is against. She feels that I am looking at other women, preaches that there is so much sex slavery out there and that I'm contributing to that, plus she feels it's the objectification of women. Her biggest issue is that I'm \"looking at other women and that whatever it is I'm looking for,\" she \"obviously can't provide.\" I told her the porn had stopped (every time she has caught me, I stop, but eventually I go back to it). The other day she walked in on me watching porn on my phone. She calmly left the room and said she was done. Now she won't listen to anything I have to say. I've told her how sorry I am and that this time it will be different, however, she won't budge, saying \"it's time to move on.\" AITAH for asking her why now. I have done worse and she's forgiven me for it and we've been able to keep our home/family together. We've gotten through the worst a marriage can go through, but now for simple porn she's going to leave me? It seems to me she's being unreasonable and blowing things out of proportion. AITAH?\n",

The few times we've discussed it in the past, we agreed that this isn't really our thing but if we ever were to get married someday, the wedding would be something really small, and it would only happen after having all our other priorities shorted out. Having said that, I love EVERYTHING romantic and he knows it. Basically that's the only reason I would consider getting married, just to share a cute romantic moment together and that includes the proposal. Also, during the time we've been together I've sent him countless videos of cute wedding proposals so he knows what I like.\n",

He said he didn't have anything planned out yet, he didn't know where we'd go or what we would do but  \"something very special will happen that day\". I jokingly said \"what, will you propose to me?\". At first he denied it, but after a few times of me guessing, he said  \"ok I wanted to propose and now you ruined it by trying to guess, I'll just do it another day so you won't expect it\" and \"I can't hide anything from you\". Needless to say that was a huge turn off for me.\n",

      "So, nothing planned. No flowers, no chocolates, no music, no romantic date, no special words. We arrived at the hotel and he just went like \"Here's your birthday gift.. I hope you're not too disappointed. Will you marry me?\". I told him to put the ring on my finger and he asked at which hand and finger it goes. I didn't like the ring either. Don't get me wrong, it was cute, but it was also the epitome of him not caring. It was clearly too loose for my finger and it was silver, when I only wear gold. 10 minutes walk from the hotel there was a beach. He knows I love the beach especially at night and he \"thought he'd propose there but he couldn't wait\".\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so happy but I was just trying my best to hide my disappointment. Later I asked him the reason he decided to propose considering that we weren't sure if we wanted to get married and he said that his stance is still the same, he doesn't really care, he just wanted to make a nice move and show me that he loves me and it's up to me to decide someday if I want to marry him(?)\n",

I never pressured him, never told him I wanted to get married and the wedding for me was a very future uncertain plan. I'd much rather he never proposed at all. I would honestly have been fine with it.

He insisted that he didn't mean it and that it was a common joke that guys say when they are asked such questions. I was absolutely disgusted and snapped at him, asking how he could possibly think that this is OK. He didn't understand why I reacted like that and said that it's no big deal, everyone says it and they all know it's a joke. But I was so appalled by his reaction that I came over to my sister's place, stayed here overnight and refused to communicate with him.

      "our marriage wasn't like most people I know, we only got married because he got me pregnant and needed to step up as the father. We met each other in college and we started off as friends but eventually I started developing feelings for him. He was dating a girl at the time and they would argue a lot, every time they would argue Damien would come to me for comfort. I didn't mind because the person I liked relied on me. One night they broke up and he got me pregnant, although it was pretty clear he didn't love me and didn't want a child by me he stepped up and married me.\n",

      "My husband was getting his PHD and was working in the hospital so money wasn't an issue. Because of the baby I had to drop out of college and once I was able to work I decided to apply as a kindergarten teacher( although my husband didn't think it was necessary). our marriage was unhappy , we never made love after I had my son and it was constant arguing. He would belittle me and remind me how I was just a pick me up. I want to also add that I'm vegan and ever since I married him I had to quit because he \"didn't want to eat a salad for dinner everyday\". while working at the elementary school I met a friend I'll call him Brandon , Brandon was the kindest person I've ever met, he would check up on me to make sure I'm ok , wed go on picnics together with our kids(he has one daughter) and since we were both vegan he'd give me some vegan recipes. Brandon made me feel true happiness unlike my husband and I was starting to fall in love with him. One day we were eating brunch and he admitted to having feelings for me. I told him I liked him too but admittedly couldn't leave my husband considering he overpowers me financially. Brandon said that he didn't care and still loved me and would start hooking up after that. One night me and Damien did the nasty for once and I got pregnant. I wasn't happy but he was overjoyed, I felt guilty because I realized how much of a shit partner he was and fell out of love with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "out of guilt I admitted to him I cheated on him out of guilt and of course he wanted a divorce. he was angry even though he's never shown any love to me, he also didn't believe the baby was his and understandably asked for a DNA test once the baby was born. We had gotten a divorce and Brandon had let me move in with him and his daughter. given Damien's wealth the courts gave him full custody of our son and I had visitation. Once my daughter was born we got the DNA test and Damien found out she was his, he also demanded custody of her but I just gave him visitation. Now that my life has settled down I decided to tell my friends and family about this and they all called me the TA. so AITA\n",

But anyways, a teacher (from the other classroom) came into the classroom and told me to go to the office, so I did, I sat on the chair. I was in one of those moods when you are angry but also sad. Now, I am suicidal so I use it to emotionally blackmail people. (Yes I know it's bad, but I stopped doing that a long time ago) I said the the teacher. \"If I kill myself, it will be on your hands\" and then that's when she said it. \"Good, the world will be a much better place\" after that she told me to go outside, I already had my pencil case, so I grabbed my compass (it's a thing that draws perfect circles) and took the pointy side and dragged it along her car, I am still paying it off.

They all seemed surprised that I never took her out for dinner and paid for us both. But I'm surprised about that because why should I pay for both our dinners just because I'm a man?

Initially, we were both on the same page. I believed she was the one for me. However, lately, I've been feeling a sense of boredom and monotony in our relationship. Our sex life is great, she's a wonderful cook, and she's objectively attractive. There isn't anything inherently wrong in our relationship, but the thought of being stuck in a repetitive routine is becoming overwhelming for me. Additionally, three of her close friends are either engaged or married, and she keeps pressuring me about when we‚Äôll take that step.\n",

      "  I had been contemplating ending the relationship because I found it increasingly difficult to pretend that everything was fine. However, last week, she told me that she had taken three different pregnancy tests, all of which came back positive. To say that I was mortified would be an understatement. Despite my best efforts to conceal my reaction, she could tell that something was off. She asked me how I felt about the situation, and I must admit that my choice of words could have been better. I asked her if abortion was an option, which caught her off guard. The following two minutes were filled with an uncomfortable silence. After that, she got up and left the apartment. Since then, she hasn't spoken with me at all, and I assume she's considering breaking up with me. Meanwhile, her friends and family have been calling me names, but I have chosen to ignore them as their opinions hold no significance to me since they aren't directly involved in this situation. Despite me feeling free and so much better now that we aren‚Äôt together anymore, I still can‚Äôt help but think I might‚Äôve been the AH.\n",

Her feelings were hurt, and she even pulled a \"I'm not going to make you any cake next year,\" which I replied with, \"I will order my own and get my money back if they don't do it like I want it.\" Apparently that was the last straw.

He said he was upset with what happened but wanted to move on from the argument because our relationship means a lot to him.

If we've been together for 2 and a half years and my feelings are starting to fade, then we should take a break. He was upset and crying a lot but I told him that this would be better for both of us.

      "So I wasn't 100% sure she was faking it when I talked back at her but later on you will see why I am now. Now to the story. Since the beginning of this week we have a new kid in my class. Let's call the girl M. Every year we have 3 weeks where we do lots of fun things and workshops instead of real lessons and that was this week. M had already in palmed 2 kids of our class with fake depression and fear disorders. We had a workshop where we had to draw our own tattoos which I'm good at and I like very much. M started touching her arms like they hurted the entire time and lots of girls didn't say anything or think much of it. Then one of my GUY friends looked at the girl next to M to ask something and didn't even look near M's arm. She started making hurtful faces and she rolled her sleeve up with cuts all over her arm but not even deep, they just looked like cat scratches but not even as deep as that. He asked: \"Bro what the hell is that?\" M just goes like \"Oh well I have depression so.\" She said it as loud as possible. He just brushed it off thinking she wouldn't want to talk about it in front of the whole class. (We were sitting with 16 on a long table entirely full, everyone could hear anything.) Then M started talking, more like yelling. \"I have been raped multiple times and I'm depressed.....\" He laughed because in the way M said it and how she didn't know any of us cause nobody really talked to her in the 2 days she was in our class, he just knew it was fake. It happened to me and I got really mad for her faking such a thing. When she finally got a special tattoo pen to tattoo her drawing on herself, she started shaking her hands a lot which she didn't while drawing. She called for a teacher and put her hand in the air yelling causing everyone to look: \"I have a fear disorder I don't think I can do this.\" The teacher said that she'll be fine and we won't get grades for it anyways. She was silent for 10 Minutes. When she started talking to my friend again about how horrible her life is and things like that. Then she started raising her voice while talking and lots of people were looking at her. My friend started laughing and a friend of M started saying how horrible that is and you shouldn't laugh at someone else their trauma. This is where I go in. I have never learned from anyone how to say things properly without being rude and I am working on it a lot, just thought I'd mention, doesn't change what I said. While still drawing peacefully on my paper I calmly said: \"Just shut the hell up both of you, of course he is laughing I mean she is totally faking it can't you see she learned her acting from Amber Heard? And even if she wasn't faking who the hell yells these things infront of a class where she doesn't know anyone and then to a guy who is a total idiot with no compassion or empathy?\" She got up and walked out of the room. I was lucky the teacher wasn't there but my friend was glad I said it because he was getting really annoyed by her, and I quote, ' Her attention seeker, Pick-me behaviour'. (His words, not mine.) (He didn't mind what I said about him because he knows he is like that and is used to me calling him idiot.) After school I heard her talking at the busstop to another friend sayin a girl is ruining her in getting boy friends in her class and is onto her. Well after that I was 100% sure she was faking it. She saw me walking by and now M looks disgusting at me everytime she sees me and her friend demands that I apologise. A part if the class thinks I was right to say that but maybe I should've said it differently and didn't make a little grin at the end, the other part of the class is staying out of it. So AITA and should I apologise?\n",

      "I went to the counselor today and she is going to talk to her and her parents, she isn't allowed to tell me if she really is faking or not.

      "\n",
      "UPDATE 2:\n",
      "So I totally forgot to do an update but I was right, she was faking all those disabilities, she had to apologise to the entire class. She apologised to everyone separately and told them to keep it secret. The school talked to the parents who signed her up for some psychology things and therapy. Most of the class don't talk to her because she was faking trauma's real people had and all that. I didn't forgive her for that but I did help her a lot at school ( Socialising ) Which I'm very bad at, me and people is not a good match. We're now friends but still a little mad.\n",

We have the picture perfect life, 3 dogs, a three bedroom house (1 for us, 1 for her makeup, and 1 for my work). However, today we were invited to my life long bestfriend S‚Äôs daughters birthday party. My wife was excited to go however I had a dinner with my two cousins first which we agreed would be partner free because we haven‚Äôt seen each other in years as we all live in in different parts of the west coast. She was completely fine with this as it was only supposed to be from 5-8, obviously timing is an issue with my family so dinner started at 6:30 and ended at 9:40 because we went for icecream me for dinner. Let it be know i messaged her every couple of minutes giving her updates of my ETA and eventually I could feel her attitude and irritation through the phone. When I arrived at our house to pick her up she was in a shitty mood which includes the silent treatment, smart add remarks and her being on her phone. As we arrived at S‚Äôs house she continued with her pissy mood and not even after ten minutes started asking when we were leaving. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating because she does the same shit to me every time but with her, I‚Äôm always the asshole or I‚Äôm being dramatic. After her asking for the third time in the first hour of being there I snapped and I pulled her aside and told her she needs to grow the fuck up and learn how to act because she didn‚Äôt need to come if she didn‚Äôt want to. In response she told me maybe if I had planned my day better she wouldn‚Äôt be giving me an attitude. I was furious so I told her to get in the car, I said my goodbyes and drove her to our house and told her to go inside and figure her shit out.

Some information, the girls at his school don‚Äôt like me and I don‚Äôt know why I think one girl developed an issue with me and it got worse. It is to the point that they‚Äôve attempted to physically attack me for being to close to my boyfriend. Anyways I was hurt from him accusing me, I was up till 1 am trying to sort it out (I have anxiety so I was having a panic attack during all of this) he wouldn‚Äôt give me straight answers or any explanation of what he was saying. He would say that just ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù told him. Later he said it‚Äôs fine claiming if I didn‚Äôt we‚Äôre good then just went to hangout with his friends. At this point I‚Äôm sitting at home in shock about what just happened and call him but no response because he‚Äôs ‚Äúat a restaurant‚Äù.

I was shocked when she told me the other vet's dog was recovering from being sick and being picky with food so they were getting it because chicken was all she would eat at the time.

She said that just because she‚Äôs slept with some of them before doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre anything more than friends now, and it‚Äôs fine to sleep over there because they‚Äôre just friends now. She then started talking about her onlyfans, and asked me how I feel about that. I said I don‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good thing but to each their own.

      "My boyfriend and I were both born and raised in a smaller town, <80k people. We went to different schools, graduated in different years, and both went out of state after graduation.  We both moved back home in 2018, and met each other shortly after moving home. We didn't ever really have an \"anniversary\" but we met and have been together ever since. We don't go out on the town very often as the bar scene is not our thing, maybe 3 to 4 times a year. Well, we went out tonight to grab a burger at a local bar and I ran into a friend from high school. We got talking and he introduced me to his new girlfriend who was adorable and sweet. We had a great talk and finished the night with hugs when we said goodbye. As we got in the car to go home, boyfriend says \"is that girls name....?\" And I said \"yes, why? Did you fuck her?\" He admits that yes, he did several years ago. This wouldn't be a problem and I'm certainly not the jealous type, but I swear every single time we go out, we meet someone new he has slept with. A few weeks ago we were having a fire in the backyard with a friend and talking about teaching children morality when boyfriend chimes in \"yeah I've had a threesome\" completely out of nowhere. Procedes to tell me it's the WIFE of one of our friends and another girl who is dating a different friend!  I get that these things happen in a small town, but just from what I know and who I've met, his \"count\" is well over 40 when mine is 7. It doesn't make me feel great about him and I got a little upset. I know that everyone has a past and its not a reflection of who he is now, but it does get annoying that everywhere we go, from the shooting range to the grocery store to restaurants on the other side of the state, we run into someone he knows and has slept with. It's hard to see all these girls and not question my own self worth when they go so far back, and it's really taking a toll on my self esteem. I don't want it to change the way I look at him, but I'm finding that it's hard not to be bitter and a little resentful... Am I being a jealous and unreasonable? How do I talk to him about it?\n",

      "I (32f at the time) was with my ex (37m at the time) for 14 years but we broke up 2 years ago and i still cant get over it. He was my best friend and a good person. However we felt more like friends than lovers. I felt sidelined all the time while he went off with his friends, left me by myself at events and weddings and he was on his phone constantly. I had to pay for most of the house and always look after him, clean up mess, help him try to focus with things like filling in forms, he was always skint because of debt (later that turned out to be a lot more debt than I thought). Along with that he had a very low libido and was mostly unaffectionate. I had to do things like ask him for a hug if I was upset, always explain or ask for my needs otherwise recieve nothing. Despite this, I loved him, we'd been through a lot together, i knew him so well, trusted and cherished him, wanted to get married and have kids with him, but I felt like he just wasn't that bothered about me and took me for granted. Doubts would creep in about us all the time. \n",

      "I would always have to be the one to make a move. We would go for months without sex. I did an experiment once, where I abstained from coming on to him and over 3 months went by until it was me that caved and made a move again. I had a low self esteem and would try to change myself and try wearing things to turn him on. I tried asking him what was going on with him a few times and why he was like this, was it me? He was very avoidant, would change the subject or distract. When i got upset and cried he told me that he didnt know, shrugging, or say maybe it was the situation we were in, such as when we moved back in with parents so it was plausable for a while (but then we would go on holiday just to two of us and it would he the same) but at the time, I believed that things would get better. The truth is I felt very lonely. We played pc games together, which would mask/ distract from the problems we had in the relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      " But this is where I failed. I had a long distance friend who I knew had a crush on me and a lot in common with. I knew he was an affectionate person who was lonely like me but a bit of a basement dweller. I would chat about platonic and mundane stuff with him, TV shows and books we both liked and it would honestly make me feel great to have someone to talk to. I was in total denial, i thought it was harmless and I sincerely believed in myself that i would never do anything to hurt my bf and nothing would come of it. I reassured my bf that it was just friendly chat, I would try to show him, include him or say how they would get along if they got to know one another but my bf didn't like him and mistrusted him. I reassured my bf it was all fine. Never kept a password from him. \n",

I was at my loneliest and lowest, and I started to fixate on the friend. Started to dream about him and fantasize about being hugged and wanted. It got too much, so i wanted to break it off, i knew this fantasy was gathering momentum. \n",

Inwanted to tell him in person, it seemed like the right thing to do after all the years. But somehow we kissed and it got a bit hot, it didnt lead to sex even though a part of me wanted it to. But i knew id made a mistake and this was wrong so i said goodbye to the friend forever..\n",

      "After this I went home and felt like I was living a lie, still couldnt stop thinking about it. I tried to get on with things. But one night I got drunk and confessed my feelings for the friend to him online and realised I needed to split up with my bf, fully intending to the next morning and went to bed. When i woke up, my bf at the time must have known something was wrong and read the messages and went mad, he grabbed me by the neck in such anger and bent me over the sofa backwards. He has never hurt me before and he must have felt so angry and humiliated after he trusted me to have this friend.\n",

      " I left my then bf in a mess, left him to fend for himself in our flat. He got so depressed he was thinking of killing himself. I went and lived in my van for a few days and eventually went to try to make a relationship with the friend. It's was a crazy time and didn't go well. \n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't work out at all because my head was an absolute mess and I was so fraught with guilt and inner conflict that I ended up not coping, breaking it off, ultimately loosing them both. Now I'm lonely, trying to pick up the peices, digest what happened and try to learn to live with myself. The friend was just a fantasy, he was the idea of something I badly craved which such a powerful thing and I guess I want to say is please whatever you do, if you have any conscience at all, don't ever do it. Try to recognise when your not happy and leave, don't be in denial or deluded. It will always end in a mess if you dont. Close one book before opening another. Really I didnt want to break up with my bf, i wanted commitment and to feel loved, adter all the years shared, we should have gone to therapy, we could have worked at it. After doing a lot of soul searching i think he had severe ADHD and attachment issues but loved me and didn't mean to make me feel the way he did. It takes me a long time to learn to trust someone and I'll be 35 next. I still go over it all in my mind torturing myself. I've lost everything and I'm afraid I may never find a good partner again and may never be able to have kids like I want to because I'll be too old and lonely.\n",

Although we've gone out on a couple dates, most of what we do is watch a movie for a bit and then make out. Typical casual college relationship.

One friend said that all I gave him was blue balls and lesson to not tell the next girl he was a virgin. Some agree with me that it's totally fair for me to not hookup with a virgin for the reasons I stated.

My husband still talked to his parents to please his other grandparents (they did everything for him! They're such adorable people if i'm being honest!). After a while we got married and not long after that we had a child. AND OH BOY!! that made things worse. S posted pictures of our kid pretending it was hers. Yes. My husband got tons of questions like \"i didn't know you were uncle? Congrats,i never knew S was pregnant!\" We asked his parents and S to take the pictures down because... That's our kid.

We told them if S doesn't take the pictures down, we would report her to the police.

Then he said, \"mom sorry, but if you're going to act like this and protect my sister. Then you shouldn't see me, my wife or our kid again\". Then she got nuts.

His father was commiting s\\*xual crimes with his sister and daughter. His mother knew about everything, was also okay with those crimes AND was treathening the victims.

She was my first girlfriend when I was 24, and we were married 23 years ago, right after my college degree, while she was still an undergraduate student. We have two kids in high school (18M and 15F). I have had some problems keeping jobs, and I even was unemployed for nearly a decade after the girl was born. Meanwhile, my wife has kept a good and ascending career since her degree. I have diagnosed (but currently untreated) Adult ADHD, which might be related to my poor job performance. This situation had a toll on our marriage. I never committed to a homemaking role, so my wife took on both responsibilities as the primary provider and housewife. There were a couple of crises before the final breakup, and I found solace on social media and engaged in low-key online flirting during these crises. The final straw came five years ago due to financial problems. My sister (49F) helped me find my current job, and then I began to work with a friend from college, helping him with the mathematical models of an app he is developing. My total income is still less than half of hers.\n",

The occasional uncommitted sex was no longer present since I moved back in. After a while, we both invested in a new apartment that would allow us to have separate rooms. Nearly all our combined incomes and her pandemic savings are currently being invested in the new apartment and expenses that are mostly related to our children, including international exchange programs and a trip that was promised to our daughter for her 15th birthday. From this tight budget, I have found ways to sneak a few bucks for personal indulgences such as premium online services or video games.\n",

A couple of months ago, I finally made a decision to invest in that with the help of dating applications. Results have been bittersweet, and I have only found a couple of significant connections. The most significant was with a woman in another city. We have never met in person yet, but we enjoyed daily conversations. She asked for some help, and I wired her some money that was within the budget of my personal indulgences. However, given some previous related investments (e.g., premium dating app services), I took a credit card advance instead of using my \"secret\" but depleted savings.\n",

She claims that she has no problem with me dating but has issues with me taking time or priorities away from the family and taking money out of the family. She also worries that any girlfriend would take advantage. Furthermore, the automatic income tax cut from her salary was increased last month, which means that our tight budget is even tighter from now on. So currently, she has more control over my cash flow, and my economic independence is out of the question.\n",

      "Then I had a really traumatic medical scare happen and then right after that scare I had such a bad fight with my sometimes emotionally abusive mom (basically after the terrible medical news, I had a panic attack, mom was in the car with me. When she dropped me off at my place about half an hour later she made a comment regarding me killing myself and not to do it now because it was inconvenient timing as she was drunk, then said I drove her to drink. The next day she claims she never said that, which I disproved because I saved the texts, and then she said she was only joking and  I just had to make everything an argument and she couldn't win when I asked her to apologize and she refused to) that she disowned me for like two weeks before realizing disowning her disabled child is bad optics and we live in a very small town where everyone knows each other and my mom loves the good optics of being the ever selfless mother to a disabled child and often rubs it in my face somehow. \n",
      "\n",
      "And so since I'd always try to go and comfort who I thought were my friends, I thought it would be okay for me to say what was going on and how hurt I was in the appropriate channel for that conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I really tried not to linger on it too much or bring everyone down but I was incredibly upset and terrifed so while I tried my hardest to be positive like normal if you knew me you could tell that I was dealing with something. Like when you have major depression and you try super hard to be functional and put a smile on your face for everyone but the people closest to you can sense something isn't quite okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the moderators of the group told me that the server was supposed to be a cheerful and happy place and it was supposed to only be positive, so if I couldn't be appropriately cheerful and happy enough then I should, and I quote 'make myself scarce'. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I was very much trying to do that but soon after what I was told above the same two moderators would DM me at like 3AM saying I was making people uncomfortable again. And I would have no clue what I did because it wasn't like I was talking very much about what happened. I think I once mentioned I was worried I wouldn't be able to get a job due to my physical disability and that I was scared trying to figure out how to afford everything. But there had been people on the group who had said way worse things and much more personal things than that. Things about abusive spouses, deciding whether or not to have an abortion, worrying how they'd raise a child if they didn't, that someone was scared because there were repeated stabbings in the area they lived in recently, issues with their jobs, worrying about housing, their meth addiction, etc. were all topics others brought up by others who as far as I know never were told to stop because they weren't publically ever redirected and they just continued to talk about those issues so I'm just making an guess based on what I saw and experienced that they weren't told to stop or that if they were, they were not stopping, and did not face consequences for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'm still trying to be a support for some of the people going through some of the stuff I mentioned above, I'm sad but trying to keep it together, but the same two moderators would DM me like clockwork every few days saying I was making people uncomfortable. When I asked what I was doing wrong so that I could change the behavior, they never answered or told me what I was doing wrong. They just continued to tell me to stop and if I asked they'd find a way to change the subject, said instead I was ruining the sanctity of the server, or would just stop messaging me until the next time one of the two would DM me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very confusing. I was very confused. I felt bad that I was making people uncomfortable apparently so much that I was DMed every few days by those two moderators because I obviously don't want to make people feel bad. But I wasn't sure what I was doing wrong and no one would tell me when I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when I mentioned that I was a bit frustrated by this I was told by one of the mods \"I know you're probably not trying to attack me or my leadership skills but your words make me feel very attacked and terrible right now\". All I said was \"Hey, I would really like to know what's going on and I'm feeling a bit frustrated because I keep hearing that I make people uncomfortable from you but when I ask what I need to change about my behavior, you never let me know what I was doing wrong. I feel kind of scared to say anything in this group anymore because I have no clue what's going to make people uncomfortable and what isn't. If there is a boundary I'm crossing, I would like to know what it is, so that I can be aware of it and respect it better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she just kept saying I made her feel like a terrible person. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I was basically kicked out by means of saying \"No one here is your friend, we're only talking about the game, no one is friends with you outside the game. Please make yourself scarce.\" so while technically I left willingly I don't believe I really had that much of a choice. I tried to problem solve but it's hard to problem solve when you're literally not told the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'd heard these people I thought were my friends talk about everything under the sun, not just the game, and even talk about things directly against the server's rules without issue. For six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it really did hurt but I figured that if they didn't want me around or feel safe with me then that was something I had to respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I ran into another person who used to be in the server and I mentioned what happened and they did tell me \"Yeah, you gave and gave and gave and were there for people whenever they needed it and I'd never seen you do something bad or hurtful especially in comparison to what other people did.\" Said person also mentioned they themselves had gotten iced out/ghosted by the group as well and that there were more people who had this going on and that the group used to be really great but their goal changed from helping people with the game and talking about life and stuff to becoming the most popular server about the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for a while I felt okay. I thought 'alright, it's not just me' and I set out to find a new server group to be on.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's where things got confusing. I was very upfront to the moderators and the admin about my previous experience and that I was worried and shy about being in a new group because of all of what happened. I was assured that they had a three warning system, that even if you got a warning then sooner or later it would be taken off the record, and they had literal flame wars before without banning anyone and it was incredibly hard to get banned.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I tried to leave what happened behind me and embrace getting to know some new friends. I will say that I did often end anything with my opinion in it with 'sorry' or 'I hope that's okay' or 'I apologize if I'm causing any issues by saying this' because I figured y'know, better to say sorry just in case if I said something that could possibly in some way some how be taken the wrong way. I didn't want to be that person making others uncomfortable again.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then about a week in I got my first warning. I was talking to another user about my recovery from an eating disorder (which was not the reason why I got in trouble, they said talking about those things were okay because I asked first) and that at one point I looked like one of those 90s heroin chic models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went to bed and woke up the next morning with a warning because I was talking about drug abuse and I had upset a lot of people. Was confused because I had been referring to the actual 1990s style of fashion which you can google and find a whole wikipedia page on but I didn't argue and decided to post on the main channel that I was sorry if I'd upset anyone the night before and if they felt unsafe because of what I said and me leaving the group for a while would make them feel better, I was okay with that. Suprisingly everyone said I didn't upset them and didn't need to apologize about it. I was also assured by the admin that it really wasn't a big deal and they wouldn't even count the warning after a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "So things went back to normal. I started to become very careful with anything I said and often added trigger warnings if needed for anything, if I said anything that was an actual joke or sarcastic, I used the joke and sarcasm tags, and if I talked too much about, really anything, it was okay to let me know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a few days ago my cat escaped outside while I was bringing in groceries from the backdoor since my garage is in the back. So I went to grab my cat and managed to just as she nearly slipped under a gap in the fence, diving down on concrete to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a connective tissue disorder. I fell a few weeks ago and dislocated three ribs, twisted three vertebrae in my neck three different ways, and dislodged the back of my skull and sacrum. From just a regular trip while walking. When I dove onto the concrete to grab my cat before she could get hit by a car or eaten by a wild animal I was in incredibly large amounts of pain. Sitting here right now, I can tell that I've torn some muscle and ligaments, that I might have dislodged my skull and pelvis again, my neck couldn't twist, and I very likely dislocated something again. My right side which I landed on is one big bruise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately I had to wait until technically today at 2pm to see my specialist to make sure I didn't do any heavy damage like organ rupture.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I just said \"Man, my cat got outside and nearly escaped, I dove after her and got injured pretty bad. I swear, one of these days I'm going to turn her into a stole (of course not really, I love my cat to death, but I am a little miffed at her right now)\".\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I got a warning for animal cruelty. And I did reiterate that I wasn't being serious but said it was fine, I understood. I said I felt kind of like I was doing more harm than good in the server and I admitted in the DM to the mod I was worried about upsetting people and I was worried no one liked me. But I still did end with saying I respected the decision and was sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I got banned. I was confused, so I messaged a mod and they said they decided right in that moment that they were going to do away with the three warning system in my case and just ban me because I had proven to not be a good member and that I wasn't a person they thought was safe and fit to be in the server. I'd barely been in the group for three weeks. I'd never even gotten into a fight or even been sarcastic. I barely ever even posted except to say \"Oh hey, nice build\" or something when people posted pictures of their designs in the game.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So once again I decided 'hey maybe i can learn from this, let me ask what exactly I did to make them come to that decision just so I can be aware for the future'. And similar enough to last time, no one could tell me what I did wrong. Just that they decided I was unsafe and a bad member of the group and they didn't want me there. I expressed that I was really confused and if they had time it would be nice to know what went wrong so I could learn but no dice. It went immediately from \"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that since I outright stated I was being hyperbolic regarding my cat and due to getting injured, it was okay but I understood that some people might still see the whole \"I'm not being serious, I love my cat\" bit and still be upset. I said I understood and was sorry. And then immediately after the server disappeared from my discord.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that one of the moderators and the admin both friend requested me and asked if we could continue being friends despite the fact they had made a unanimous agreement to ban me (which they told me it was, everyone said yes, I'd never even talked to most of them let alone knew who were moderators). \n",
      "\n",
      "I said \"Well, you just told me you all unanimously agreed to ban me and bypass the three warning system even when you told me that you always kept that system, that my first warning wasn't serious, and that you've had people actually have flat out flame wars before without banning everyone. I let you know I was a bit vulnerable because of my last experience but you reassured me that unless I started actively spouting hate speech, I would never be banned. I've asked what I did wrong and all that was said was you didn't think I would mesh well with the others\" (despite not having been there for even a month yet to even know who everyone was)  \"I feel kind of hurt by this and I'm not sure I really want to remain being your friend if you thought I was causing so many issues that it was unanimously agreed upon to not use the warning system and not give me a heads up and just ban me and I'm not really sure I can trust you knowing all of that.\" I asked one last time \"Well, can you let me know what went wrong so in the future I don't make the same mistake?\" Nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I was pleaded with to remain the two of them's friend and told to not lose touch with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's where it ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don't know what to think or how to feel. I've mentioned it to a few of my irl friends who all said that it sounded like I wasn't the problem there especially after I recounted word-for-word everything that happened (would've taken screenshots but I couldn't view any pages to take said screenshots). A lifelong friend told me \"Hey, I'm never gonna bullshit you. If I thought you were in the wrong I'd say so and I think there's something else going on here that isn't about you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But I've always heard the saying, if you encounter one asshole, they're the asshole. If you keep encountering assholes all day, you're the asshole.\n",
      "\n",
      "And since it happened one after the other even though I'd been on one group for six months without a problem and the other for three weeks, I'm now concerned that maybe I am the bad guy here because  both happened one after the other, both brought up 'uncomfortableness' or 'not a good fit', and that maybe I just did something so heniously wrong they feel like they can't even tell me what it was. Maybe it's me who is the problem since I'm the common denominator other than they're both discord servers for the same game and both happened very quickly (the first happening in the span of maybe two weeks and the second happening in the span of two days). \n",
      "\n",
      "I do know that there was a moderator from the older server I was on that was also a moderator on the new server I joined.\n",
      "\n",
      "But other than that, I'm honestly really confused. I wish I'd known what I'd done because knowing is the only way you can grow from your mistakes but I wasn't even told that. I'd never gotten into any fights, tried to be there for others, said nice things to others, was kind, talked people down from panic attacks, didn't argue with their reasoning for warnings, joked around with everyone else and thought we were at least friends after six months in the first group and barely even got the time to actually know anyone in the second. Like I could not tell you a single screenname other than the two mods who keep messaging me saying that they still wanted to be friends even though they voted me off the island, so to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so that saying is playing in my head over and over. If you run into one asshole, you've run into an asshole, if you keep running into assholes, you're the asshole. I'm trying to think about what I could have done in both groups that was so bad that I wasn't even told what it was because like, this isn't a pattern in my life. I've had friend grows that organically grew apart from each other as we grew up and there wasn't any fighting or bad behavior involved. We just became different people and began to have different interests. Which I think is normal. You don't necessarily stay friends with the people you were friends with in middle or high school or even college for the rest of your life. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I can't find a pattern, I've still not been told what exactly it was I did by either server, but I know I didn't fight or argue with them and I know at least in the first server I was not the only one to experience issues with the moderators. \n",
      "\n",
      "But like, doesn't there have to be something? This doesn't happen twice like that right out of the blue. I had to have done something wrong that I'm not seeing, right? I honestly don't know anymore. So while I am a little scared to ask, not necessarily because it means I might face criticism but because I would feel awful if I did something so horrid they threw the rules out the window and decided I was a threat that needed to go because like I don't know about anyone else but I'm not fond of hurting others and I would be sad to know I hurt others. Not because I got punished but because it happened in the first place and like, if you've caused others pain shouldn't you feel bad about it anyway? \n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I guess I am asking reddit's opinion. This is what I experienced. I have no clue what they would say if you asked them considering I already tried to ask what they felt like I was doing to cause problems and never was told anything more than the line \"You make people uncomfortable\". So I understand that what I've said is how it happened through my eyes and I can't read minds obviously so unless they told me what I did I really am not sure. I know I didn't insult anyone, I know I didn't get into fights, I know that even when I was sad I tried very hard to be happy, I know that at least two people had the same experience in the first server and that the new server I joined had one of the same moderators, I know that I tried to always be polite, kind, and courteous, I know that I'm not perfect and might be overlooking something, and I know that all I really want is to know what, if anything, I did wrong so I can not do it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not sure who or what to believe. I'm not sure if it's me who is the asshole, if they're the assholes, if no one is the asshole, or if everyone is an asshole. But since I remembered that quote and this happened in such a short timespan from each other, I am concerned that maybe I am the asshole. Right now I feel kind of like I am crazy and can't trust my own thoughts because maybe my thoughts are twisted somehow and that's why I'm not understanding what I've done. \n",
      "\n",
      "Or maybe there's an entirely different reason. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know that I can only give half of a story since multiple people can all have different stories on the same event. I can only say what I perceived. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like I'm going to get answers to know anything about the other opinions or things I might have done wrong or much information from the anyone at this point in time. So I can only ask in regards to what I believe to have happened and maybe that means there is insufficient information for you to form an answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I figured I'd ask anyway, AITAH? Can you see something I don't? Is there something I'm missing? Is it a me thing? Or is it like my other two friends said when they said they didn't see anything I could've done wrong in either group.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do feel like I am crazy at the moment. I know this is ungodly long. I apologize. I tend to be long winded with, well, everything. Seriously, my dad used to challenge me to explain things in five sentencs or less and I could never beat that challenge. So if you've read this far, no matter what your judgment is, thank you.\n",

      "I (18F) have been going through a tough time with my boyfriend (21M). I‚Äôm AA and he‚Äôs Caucasian. He liked to joke constantly about racism, all while being a bit ignorant to the stuff going on today and in history. I‚Äôve grown up in a predominately white space, and even then my friends have never said the things he has. I, myself, can and have joked about the things that happened to me or people that look like me every once in a while, but things have gone extremely far with my boyfriend. One day I caught a glimpse of him saying the N word and other extremely racist things in a group chat with his old coworkers. He explained that one of them (coworker) is black, and basically encourages his white counterparts to joke around the way they do. But at this particular point, I was disgusted and fed up, considering this wasn‚Äôt his first time doing the things he has. \n",
      "\n",
      "At that point, I initially broke up with him. Even though I didn‚Äôt WANT our relationship to be over, I felt that he wouldn‚Äôt change and left for my dignity.

My boyfriend and I eventually worked things out, and since then he‚Äôs done good, and has been a lot more sensitive about race and not joking about it. He hasn‚Äôt reached out to his coworkers either. Even then, I feel because everything happened the way it did, my feelings were starting to get confusing. And I missed my ex. And because I‚Äôm not that kind of girl, I had to be honest and sit my boyfriend down, to let him know where my heart was possibly at. \n",

We had a lot to drink and ended up making out. I immediately felt terrible and called an uber to go home.   \n",

He told me that if I didn‚Äôt block michael, we were breaking up. Of course I didn‚Äôt want to block him. I yelled at my fianc√© that I would never do that to my best friend. He got mad and stormed out the house.   \n",
      "I texted him that Michael wouldn‚Äôt treat me that way. He got even more upset and told me that we were over. Soon after that happened michael asked me out, and well‚Ä¶. I said yes.

      "My direct cousin 35f has been showing jealousy towards me for my looks ever since we where teenagers. I 32f have never had a problem with weight gain and I would acquire the body I wanted pretty easily ever since I started healthy eating and fitness. My cousin on the other hand struggles with emotional eating and her depression meds make her CHONKY, she has tried to kill herself twice when she was much younger due to insecurity. All I do is wear clothes that show off my body and never tell my cousin anything about her weight but she is still offended of how I dress and tries to make me look stupid for how I eat. She has told people behind my back that I dress like a hooker and how my clothes are sl*tty. Every time I eat my healthy diet when she is present she would make herself look like she is so wholesome for eating whatever she wants because life is short yet she makes comments to make me look like a fool for following ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù diets. She even goes as far calling the healthy food I cook for myself disgusting and she praises her own cooking and says how everyone wants to eat what she makes and no one would like my food. When I go to relative gatherings she would comment loudly on how my clothes are revealing and how I look like a cheap hooker. I‚Äôm honestly so sick and tired of her. Today I did not let her cross the line; she told me that I probably want to get rap*d if I wear these clothes in public ‚Äútempting men on purpose‚Äù. I got really angry and I told her it‚Äôs so obvious she‚Äôs jealous of my physical appearance and it‚Äôs been known for a long time because she can‚Äôt bring herself to take care of her body so she has to constantly humiliate me and exalt herself in order to feel like she‚Äôs the big deal. My truth was confirmed when she ran off crying and told the extended family how I shamed her for her weight and how my words ‚Äúare so cruel‚Äù. Her parents confronted me the next day saying how she has always struggled with her weight and eating and demanded I apologize. It‚Äôs not my fault if she wants to be a pig and get triggered by my looks instead of taking care of herself and having her own sexy body.\n",

      "Next year one of my sisters is getting married. The wedding is in Mexico, not here. One of the rules they have for their guest list is \"no ring, no bring\" meaning anyone who isn't married doesn't get to bring a plus 1, they are only invited themselves and don't get to bring another person.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my brothers has been with his girlfriend for 14 years. However they are not married and don't want to be. They live together and are essentially husband and wife in all but name, but they both say marriage isn't what they want. His girlfriend is not invited to the wedding, only my brother is. When he found out he said he's not going to the wedding now. I think he's wrong and is being stubborn about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggested his girlfriend come to the resort (it doesn't sell day passes or all non-guests on the property at all) and spend the week there with everyone. She can do her own thing on the day of the wedding but otherwise make a vacation of it with my brother. He says that's not enough because she's still excluded from the wedding. He said if he is expected to spend thousands on a trip to Canc√∫n and endure a 6-7 hour flight each way he would want his girlfriend to be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "He acknowledges that my sister and her fianc√© can invite whoever they want but he also thinks it is ridiculous for them to exclude people who aren't married if the two of them are not the ones paying for anyone's trip to Mexico. He said if he was going to take a vacation with his girlfriend it would be one they actually want to go on. I also suggested he come just for the wedding and leave immediately afterwards until I found out you have to stay for the whole week to get the discount you get if you are going to the wedding. My brother also said only going for the wedding is impractical and a waste of time and money.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think he's overreacting. He said he'll give them a nice gift but that he's skipping the wedding. The \"no ring, no bring\" rule is not because of religious reasons (no one in my family or my sister's fianc√©'s family is religious and the ceremony won't have any religious elements) and it's not solely directed at my brother's girlfriend. My sister's fianc√© has a sister who is in a long term relationship but isn't married and this affects him too, as well as other many of the other people who are invited.

      "My boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) were taking a shower together, and when it seemed as though we were both done, he said I could get out but he wanted to stay in. This is normal, since he regularly takes longer showers than I do. However, a few days ago, before we had sex, he told me that when he came on my face it wasn't the 'load' that we was expecting it to be since he masturbated in the shower earlier after I got out. No big deal, everyone does it, I was just a bit caught off guard since I was wondering why he took so long in the shower this particular instance but just shrugged it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to the present; I asked him if he wanted me to get out so that he could masturbate again, and his response was 'no' but then his member started to grow and he admitted that since I put the thought in his head, he did suddenly want to. He asked me several times if I would be mad, which honestly felt like a trap because who am I to be mad if he wants such private time? However, before getting out, I did voice that I would rather join in and masturbate myself as he did, or even just watch him, or possibly do it for him. He just did so in the shower a few days ago so this time I just wanted to feel included. I suppose I was being selfish by wanting to. He said he just wanted to be alone, and as I got out of the shower he asked me to bring his phone to him from the other room; he didn't SAY it was to watch porn but I know him well enough to know that's exactly why he wanted his phone. When he got out of the shower he said he would explain why he wanted to be alone, so I waited. When he did get out I was obviously being rather gloomy as I waited for an explanation that never came, as he later said that he\n",
      "'forgot'. We then got into an argument, as I couldn't understand that if I was visibly feeling down when I left the shower- why did he choose to continue to masturbate instead of waiting until later? We were supposed to go out to eat after our shower, and I hadn't eaten all day and made a point to verbalize my hunger several times before our shower yet instead of waiting until after dinner he decided to go through with it. He maintains that there's nothing wrong with him wanting to do so and deciding to do it right then and there, knowing how I felt about being left out & being eager to go eat. I just feel like an awful person now because the argument lasted at least an hour with every finger being pointed at me, since he genuinely feels as though he did nothing to apologize for and that 'my entitlement to his private time is alarming' :( .

      "A little, but important, backstory. My mother was hit by a car while walking and died 6 months ago. It was traumatic and awful, and I have been struggling with pretty awful grief.  The last 3 weeks we have spent cleaning our her house and wading through the emotional ups and downs that brings. I work full time as a nurse, we have 3 kids (11,10,9) all in multiple extracurricular activities, and I‚Äôm additionally in school trying to earn my masters for family nurse practitioner. Needless to say we are busy and stressed. My husband has been more than supportive through this whole thing, and when his high school buddies asked him to get together for a boys weekend, I was all on board for him getting some time away. I offered to figure out the kids school/activities/my school so he could have a break. I bought him clothes for the trip, I baked brownies for them to share, I packed snacks and booze, I made batch cocktails and sent all our marijuana (it‚Äôs legal in our state) with him. I wanted it to be the best weekend ever. I had only two requests. -1.) please be safe and don‚Äôt die\n",
      "-2.) no strip clubs\n",
      "I know the latter is controversial. I know he wouldn‚Äôt cheat on me. It just makes me feel terrible. And I know that‚Äôs my problem, but I also feel like it‚Äôs a small ask. There are a million and one other things under the sun to do, just no strippers. No shame at all to the industry at all either. That is hard work, and those ladies are very talented. It‚Äôs just not for me. \n",
      "So he texts me he loves me. And I‚Äôm about to go to bed and I‚Äôm curious where the night has taken them, so I check his location. He‚Äôs at Skin Cabaret. I confront him, and he doesn‚Äôt deny it. But he also acts like there wasn‚Äôt anything he could do. He said that another member of their group didn‚Äôt want to go either. Somehow he thinks that will make me feel better. All I hear is 1/2 the group didn‚Äôt want to go, so you had an out, and you still went. After promising me you wouldn‚Äôt. Twice. He said ‚Äú I didn‚Äôt do anything, I texted you the whole time.‚Äù But what he doesn‚Äôt understand is I never thought he would cheat. It just fills me with doubt. He says I mean everything to him, but I guess not more than saving face to his buddies. What matters is he broke a promise and didn‚Äôt tell me about it. I had to figure it out on my own. So now he wants to come home, and I just don‚Äôt want to be around him. I told him to finish his boys weekend. So AITA for getting mad and  asking him to not come home?\n",
      "\n",
      "Update- not sure if this is how you update but here it goes. When I said ‚Äúnot come home‚Äù I meant immediately. He wanted to end the boys weekend, and come home early. I told him he needs to stay and finish the weekend, and that we could talk in a few days when he comes home. I wasn‚Äôt intending on kicking him out. Also, I‚Äôm aware I have insecurities. I see a therapist routinely. But I was open and honest that one thing made me feel uncomfortable, and I didn‚Äôt think it was a huge ask to request he not do that. I would have been a lot less hurt if he told me point blank he didn‚Äôt know if he could promise that and it depended on the group. My husband and I share everything. We talk constantly all day. I was curious where they were at, not suspicious. I didn‚Äôt text and ask because I was trying to be respectful and not bug him with my texts. That‚Äôs the only reason I checked his location. Yes, I think I would have been less hurt if on the way there he sent me a text saying he was sorry, but they were on their way to a strip club. I think he was hoping I wouldn‚Äôt find out. But once I did there was no reason to deny it. That hurts a lot too. I do recognize those women are beautiful. They probably do have way better bodies then me. Than most of us. That‚Äôs not the point. I‚Äôm not holier than thou, I‚Äôm an atheist and pretty liberal on my beliefs about sex and nudity. That‚Äôs also not the point. My husband and I have a great sex life, well I think so. Unless something extreme happens in the day we are intimate most every night. That also, is not the point. The point is I asked him not to, he said he wouldn‚Äôt, but ultimately saving face with his friends was more important to him than keeping a promise to his wife of 14 years\n",

Be has attempted to start other businesses and I have financed them as well. He is living in hotels and I provide the cc for his deposits and whatever else he needs- I was told he would help pay the cc but in 4 years he has made maybe 2 payments. I have begun to pull back on my assistance since I have begun to experience some real financial hardships but instead of getting a job (he says he can't cause he owes so much back child support) I am told as his \"wife\" I should support him (we are not married).

I also figured by blocking the military that it would appease their expectations and not offend them so they wouldn't see the problems they would hate. I don't think what I did was based on prejudices, more I don't want to offend anyone. It's easier to be a people pleaser when you have people who are easy to please. \n",
      "\n",
      "The issue with that group was that because the person was a Marine he expected everyone to bow to him. When I refused to change my style to suit his views and tastes, I was viewed as lazy. I allowed myself to be kicked out because it was easier than trying to change what I couldn't physically change. He also brought up the fact as a fantasy author that I made the group look less legit and I didn't want to drag the group down. I was again not part of the majority and it made me look rather stupid. I didn't fight or appeal the case or complain.\n",

      "So my roommate 21M has a gf19F who is apparently right months pregnant. They started seeing each other in December and she isn giving it up for adoption, so whatever. I don't actually care about it. The part I care about is, last week having a discussion with someone I thought was my best friend, enough to live with him at the very least, not telling me so I just had to notice his girlfriends right month pregnant baby bump with no context knowing he didn't want kids and knowing that she does and knowing that he complains about putting in effort to see her if he won't be getting laid.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been telling me for MONTHS, since they started dating there was a \"life situation and he wasn't sure how it was gonna work out or if he wanted to be with her because of it\" and this is it, so the fact that, he has still been saying her pregnancy might be a deal breaker without a warning that \"oh shit she's showing she doesn't want to talk about it and since she's coming over today on maternity clothes instead of hiding the bump you should know\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He can't see that he put me in a position where I'm looking at my best friend who, like four days ago told me dating a woman with a child under the age of 7 would be a deal breaker, and his READY TO POP girlfriend, who was staying the night, while not knowing if I could ask anything or say congrats or even ask about it because he's been saying \"it's this big secret she doesn't want other people to know but I'll tell you eventually\" since November when they started talking online. And this is it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I told him a warning would've been nice cuz, of I say the wrong thing I look like an asshole and he gets to comfort his girlfriend, and I can't be expected to just sit and pretend like she isn't pregnant, he hasn't been saying kids are a deal breakers and this big life issue could make him break up with her. I didn't say this out loud, in front of her, I left and he texted me asking why I left. I told him that I figured it out and I thought he didn't want kids, so a warning would've been nice considering his attitude towards her making this looks like he's screwing over this pregnant girl and will leave her once the kid comes out and he would have to step up. I was angry so I left a d he told me I was an asshole for expecting him to warn me since I'm not her friend. And the only other people he's told (including his boss), are parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "He continues to say that this doesn't effect me, even though I've explained why it did, and that it didn't matter if it was literally five minutes in advance, considering we had waited for like half an hour in the car to get her off of work after getting lunch in the area where he could've, at any point, said \"she's showing, she's pregnant, she's not keeping it, it's not mine, she doesn't want to talk about it\". Even while she was walking to the car, wearing a maternity top, and I would've been fine just so I didn't have to learn it by seeing her bump and be put in a position where I could upset or embarrass her unintentionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the thing is, when I asked him what he wanted me to do about it, he couldn't answer and just said it was none of my business again, so he doesn't even know what he would do in that kind of stressful position. And this is after several arguments where he blames me for being overly sensitive because of my auslrism and sever social anxiety, so him not telling me to warm me about a situation that would be stressful for ANYONE let alone someone who can't read social cues and is extremely anxious because of it constantly.\n",

      "I 17(F) am dating my boyfriend 18(M) and we have been together for 1 1/2 years. A little context‚Ä¶. Last year I found out my boyfriend we will call him Carlos cheated on me at prom. He ended up making out with one of his ex flings at the after party (after not inviting me to go with him). We worked through this and I thought maybe it was a one time kind of thing or it was just the excessive drinking he partook in that night. Well last month I found out Carlos was continuing to cheat on me with upwards of 10 girls. He was taking them on dates, making out with them, sleeping with them, you name it he was doing it. This broke me as the first time he cheated I became extremely insecure especially after finding out the only reason he showed any interest in me was because of a ‚Äúbet‚Äù between him and his friends. Now on to what you‚Äôre all here to hear about. After I found out about all of the cheating, I still didn‚Äôt leave. I stayed due to insecurity and longing to have a partner in life. His best friend 18(M) well call him Cam became a great help to me during this time. Cam called and checked in on me, texted me often and we had some of the best talks about life i‚Äôve ever had. So now present day. Last week I went over to Cams to work on a project for school. Once I got there we began working and soon we were making out on his bed.After this I went home and we continued talking daily. Well last night I went over again and well you guessed it, we did the thing. It wasn‚Äôt anything special but I felt special during it because I could tell her cared deeply about me and I hadn‚Äôt felt that way with Carlos in a long time. I told Carlos about everything tonight when he confronted me about it. Needless to say he called me every name in the book and told me his cheating and mine were completely different because I did it with his best friend. I however feel like yes it was wrong but by no means is it worse than what he had done and part of me felt joy making him hurt how i had been hurting for almost half of our relationship. So am I the asshole?\n",

      "So yesterday I (19 f) met with my boyfriend (26 m) . We had a meal at a Mex-tex place and a walk since the restaurant was far away. During that time I sensed that something was off with him, but after a few \"are u okay\" and \"what's wrong\" he told me he doesn't want to talk about it, so I let it go and tried to distract him. The walk back home was completely silent. Then we were home I started asking him if he was okay and what's up again and he finally gave in. He told me and I quote: \"I dont want to offend you but the way you were acting really triggered me and made me cringe and feel really uncomfortable, so I was annoyed at you today\". these words really broke me and shattered my world. I quickly gathered my things, said goodbye and left his appartement. I dont know how I was able to hold the tears that long but as soon as the door shut I started crying, I cried the whole way home, on the bus as well (the ride was about an hour long) once I calmed down, my first thought was \"what an ass\".\n",
      "\n",
      "so, this is what made my boyfriend cringe: I got excited about Mex-tex food so I started sing a silly song, it went something like this \"we are going to eat Mexican food and there will be tacos, and nachos, and enchilados and I will be happy and you will be, woohoo!\". then while he was smoking in his building inner yard I started doing an impression of \" el Tigre\" there was also a move with my hands towards him and stuff. I did this a few times, then also started dancing and making cobras movements with my hands. I dont know, I was just joking and messing around. the \"el Tigre\" was an impression from one of my favourite tv shows \"community\" character, a Spanish teacher - se√±or Ben Chang.( I showed him a couple episodes of the show but I dont think he recognised the impression since he wasn't really into the show). anyways, when I think I started complimenting him and talking to him in French and in a sassy French accent(it was an imaginary character I was playing) this apparently was also very cringe. \n",
      "\n",
      "after I calmed down and was home, I called him to talk it out. I heard more details why my behaviour was cringe. turns out, it makes him cringe then people pretend to be someone their are not, for example people who can't sing, thinking that they can and still singing. as for me, I was pretending that I know French and even showing off, because I would talk in French loudly just so that people around me would know I speak French, even tho I dont. for the reference, its my first year studying French philology, ever since I found out that this will be my studies I started saying little phrases in French while talking with him to try to remember the language that I studied in high school for five years. for some time it was my dream to go away to study in France so I was taking private lessons with my teacher for an year and a half. I dont know how me practicing French and speaking in a silly French accent is cringe or how I am pretending to know French then I dont but okay. anyways, while we were talking he tried to explain to me why how I acted made him cringe and uncomfortable and annoyed. in my opinion, these days a lot of people say that they cringe then people do something that they themselves aren't comfortable doing or just feel insecure about. for example, I am very confident, loud and social person, whereas my boyfriends is a bit socially awkward and silent. he disagreed with that and said that it was just cringe and would be cringe for anyone. I agree that some people may cringe seeing a girl sing a stupid song, doing el Tigre movement or talking in a bad French accent, but he is not some people, he is my boyfriend. he should know that this is just my personality and I dont know...like it? considering that I do these stupid things quite often I started overthinking, maybe he was always cringing and was annoyed at me but just didn't tell me? which basically could mean that he doesn't like big part of me, maybe he doesn't like me at all, maybe he is just tolerating me? anyways, later on that phone call he said the way I acted was just cringe, annoying, weird and childish. that broke me, so I told him to go find someone who isn't weird, cringe, annoying or childish. maybe not a 19yo :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think nowadays a lot of people cringe at other people then they are just living their life, making silly jokes that nit everyone finds funny or even then someone is trying and failing to do something, which I think is just a toxic mindset. I dont know, maybe I really am cringe, but even if that's true, I would expect my closest people to be okay with that, why else we would be dating or be friends if you dont like this part of me and it makes u feel so uncomfortable? me, I really dislike judge people. I dislike than people cringe at others doing what they want with their life and I value acceptance and being open minded.

      "Hello, Reddit! I am Scar, the uncle of Simba from the Lion King. Recently, my reputation has been severely damaged due to the events that took place in the Pride Lands. Many people think that I am a ruthless and power-hungry villain who betrayed his own family and caused chaos in the animal kingdom. However, I am here to tell you that this is not entirely true.  First of all, I want to clarify that I never intended to kill Mufasa, Simba‚Äôs father. I admit that I was jealous of him and that I wanted to become the king of the Pride Lands, but I never planned to harm him physically. Unfortunately, the stampede that caused his death was an accident that I could not have foreseen or prevented.  Secondly, I want to point out that I did not want to harm Simba either. On the contrary, I saw him as my own nephew and I even tried to offer him some advice about how to live a carefree life. However, when he came back to the Pride Lands and challenged me for the throne, I had no choice but to defend myself and my position as the rightful king.  Lastly, I want to emphasize that I did not destroy the Pride Lands or its inhabitants. On the contrary, I tried to make the most of the scarce resources that we had and to keep the kingdom running smoothly. Yes, I had to ally myself with the hyenas, but only because I saw no other way to maintain order and prosperity in the Pride Lands.  So, Reddit, I ask you: Am I really the villain that everyone thinks I am? Or am I just a misunderstood lion who made some tough decisions for the greater good? AITA for trying to prove that I am not the bad guy in this story?\n",

After at the end of the relationship it started to get boring and I say that in a nice but not hurtful way. We didn‚Äôt see each other for a bit and I felt like I needed something from someone so I went and met a friend and we ending up having sex at his house and I kinda just kept it to myself.

      "I (16 m) am a junior in high school, and for a long time people have hated the history teacher, Miss Chandy . she always talks incredibly fast, so I can‚Äôt get my notes down in time and she also screams on occasion. As well as the fact that her homework assignments are pretty darn difficult. So one day I was in Ms Chandy‚Äôs history class and as usual i‚Äôm struggling to get my notes down fast enough with her speaking at the speed of light. I raised my hand and said ‚Äúyou need to slow down when u speaking because i can‚Äôt keep up with u‚Äù and she simply replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve only got one class period to get these notes to you guys, so maybe take a picture of the board‚Äù I felt that it was super unfair for her to not just slow down her teaching, but instead of mentioning it again I gave her a Mean look and continued to try to get my notes in. She just sighed and continues to speak incredibly fast. So then after her class i have lunch and then i see her in the lunchroom as it was her turn to patrol. i tirned to my friend and said ‚Äúgoddamnit it‚Äôs her.‚Äù and he said ‚Äúyeah she‚Äôs kinda strict but she‚Äôs not that bad‚Äù and i got super pissed. i turned and looked him in the eye and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll are you in her class she‚Äôs a fat bitch‚Äù and then i have a brilliant idea. while my friend group wasn‚Äôt looking i sneakily walk out of the lunchroom and back to her classroom with my sharpie in my hand. I was trying to think of how to get payback using the sharpie, when i saw her desk. i drew a giant thick penis on her desk, so much so that it touched both ends. when I returned to school the next day and got to her class she looked very disturbed and unhappy. there was a tablecloth on her desk. She gave my class a look and said, ‚Äúi‚Äôm not going to dish out punishment, i just want to know who vandalized my classroom.‚Äù i laughed out loud, and she gave me a look. i got suspended a few days later, but i think that was unnecessary.

So anyways, I‚Äôve been seeing him for a while and we‚Äôve become very close, I sleep at his house almost every night and we spend a lot of time together. I‚Äôm an emotional person and I tend to develop feelings quickly so I eventually asked him if he considered me to be his gf and he said no, that‚Äôs not a good idea because our age gap is too big for any serious commitment between us.

Again, this is normal for us to do when he‚Äôs at work late or something and I come over and wait for him so we can go to bed together. He told me that he wasn‚Äôt going to be home until maybe midnight and he didn‚Äôt want to rush things so it would be better if I didn‚Äôt come over that night. This whole time he‚Äôs responding so slow when he usually texts me back right away. I got suspicious and asked if the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù was his ex and he admitted that it was.

Which is lopsided to where im paying like 70% of everything. I did this because we make about the same money, but she has student debt, a car payment(i drive a clunker), and came into the marriage with a bunch of credit card debt shes repaying.\n",

      "Anyway the other day i opened a browser, her email was there, and she had a receipt from the church. I got curious and saw she had donated on average 380 a month all year. Her car payment is 400 dollars, and shes paying me 600 keep in mind for rent. Neither one of us a wealthy. We are basically a car accident away from being flat broke.\n",

      "Throwaway cause family and friends know my personal account. Backstory cause I really need advice and need clarity about this whole mess. I (29) started dating a long time friend of mine let's call him H. We had known each other for over a decade, and we have been there for each other through thick and thin. We finally confessed our feelings for each other in 2021 and started dating officially. Around the summer of 2021 my mom (60f), brother (34m) and sil (34f) confronted me about their \"worries\" about my boyfriend H. They said that they were uncomfortable with my relationship with him as he had stolen from me in the past. And even looked up his public record and found his rap sheet and were disapproving of how many \"crimes\" he had committed in the past. I got into a huge argument with them over this and they kept throwing in my face that he had multiple burglary, robbery, stalking, harassment, and domestic abuse charges blah blah blah. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will admit that I lost my cool because I ended up screaming at them and said some really awful things. I already knew all of those things about him so it's not like they were presenting new info to me. No matter how much I explained to them that he was a changed man and that they did NOT know him and his heart and the efforts he had made into trying to change they did not accept my explanations. They even accused me of putting my 8 year old son (from a previous relationship) in danger by purposely keeping him around a \"felon\". I threw them out of my apartment at that point I was hurt that they would dare to insinuate that I wasn't smart or aware enough of how to keep my son safe and that I was trying to hurt him with my \"dumb\" choices. They also yelled at me for starting to lose control of my finances because H and I had gotten a few dogs and said that I did not have the means to provide for H, myself, several pets and a child on my \"minimal income\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to early 2022 H and I were still doing great regardless of what others thought about our relationship and I got pregnant. I developed several health complications and was completely unable to work and lost my job due to the high risk pregnancy and myriad of health issues. Bills started piling up and H and I were fighting a lot as he wasn't able to hold down a job and was not helping me around our home either. It eventually culminated in H snapping at my son who foolishly decided to \"stick up for me\". And H very regrettably put his hands on my son. The argument got worse cause I did not approve of him disciplining my child and H snapped again, and slammed me against the wall and choked me until I blacked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short, son and I were both hospitalized from my blacking out and my boy had his head bounced off a table when H grabbed and threw him. I need to clarify that I am not stupid and I know that what happened was unacceptable. I stopped talking to H at the hospital then and there at that night and avoided him. I did not have anyone else but my mom, SIL and brother to turn to and they did take very good care of me during me and my son's recovery. But I could tell they were very angry at what had happened and were disappointed in me though they did not ever say this to my face. Eventually I got tired and confronted them to say what they were obviously wanting to say to my face. And all 3 ended up saying that they were disappointed that I had blown off their repeated warnings about how \"dangerous\" H was and that like they said would happen not only did H harm my son but also me and my unborn at the time daughter. I was furious with them and for rubbing this in my face when I had just gone through DOMESTIC ABUSE and almost died. They denied that they were rubbing anything in my face and expressed more \"concern\" about my present and future and even asked if I was going to have an abortion. I am pro choice however I myself would never have an abortion. And frankly told them this and they simply told me that while it was indeed my choice it would incredibly difficult for me to support two children now on zero income and that they have no clue how I would pull this off financially. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I could have cut them off forever there. But I shortly got evicted from my apartment which was a surprise for me as I had thought I had some wiggle room due to COVID and the eviction moratorium. I had to swallow my pride and move in with my mom. Fast forward to now i have given birth luckily without complications to my beautiful baby girl. I still live with my mom and I can tell she's miserable as I \"destroyed\" her plans of moving into a retirement community that she had been long planning for. And now she constantly complains about how she has zero privacy and can't stand how cramped everything is with me, my baby, and my son all together in a 2 bed and 2 bath. She accuses me of not cleaning enough or picking up after myself or the kids and not helping her financially. I have reminded her time and time again that I am a DOMESTIC ABUSE SURVIVOR and that I am a single mom to two children. The father of my son refuses to pay child support and I've honestly given up trying to pursue anything through the state for child support. And H basically ghosted me after a few months after the incident happened. I tried to reason with him that he needed to be in his daughter's life and that I still believe in him that he can change. But every time I brought up the topic of helping me support our baby financially he would become distant. And eventually just up and left entirely. I do get assistance from the state for both of my children and we get WIC and food stamps but it's honestly not enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mom is now threatening to kick me out as her landlord has found out that I have been squatting with my mom for over a year now. I did try to apply for the apartment when I first moved in with my mom last year but due to the prior eviction I was not approved. I had nowhere else to go and am only with my mother because I have no choice. I finally reached out again to my brother and SIL and asked them for some money and to help me find a house to rent in the area they live in. They live in a very nice neighborhood and I know that there are always houses for rent in that area. I gave them my requirements for exactly what I needed - at least a 3 bed and 2 bath, and that I would like to finally start buying things to build a nursery for my baby. And I spent quite a but of time putting together this list of what I needed and sent it to them. Mind you - both my brother and my SIL had complained for years that I was too disorganized and unmotivated to ever do anything properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well i sent them a very detailed list and breakdown of what i needed before moving out of my mom's. I did not receive a reply for weeks and my mom was getting more and more irate. So I demanded a meeting with my brother and SIL so that we could discuss things like adults. This is where I may have been the asshole. We met at my favorite restaurant last night and I confronted them about how cold and cruel they had been for the past year not communicating with me. They didn't even bother talking about how they had been no contact with me for over a year now. And angrily asked me how I plan on affording rent a 3 bed 2 bath house let alone apply for one with a prior eviction on my record and with zero income. \n",
      "\n",
      "I reminded them for the billionth time that I am NOT stupid and that I know that I myself can't afford rent or get approved for an application and that if they had read my email to them PROPERLY that they would have understood that I was asking them to apply on my behalf as they make more then enough money to rent a house for me and my kids on their combined income. The lease would be in their names and myself and the kids would just live in the house until I can find a place of my own and truly get back on my feet. I reminded them that they know how independent I am and how I hate asking for help. But that they needed to grow up and get their priorities straight as they would be doing this to help a single mom and their niece and nephew. \n",
      "\n",
      "They refused and said that they already felt that they had done more than enough last year when they helped pay for all of my moving expenses during the eviction as they had to hire movers and a truck last minute. And that they were still currently paying the rent for the several storage spaces a majority of my and my son's belongings are kept in the meantime as my mom refused to let me move everything in from my old 2 bedroom apartment after the eviction. My SIL knows how sensitive I am about what had happened to me and everything that I have gone through but she still chose to reopen old wounds and angrily told me that on top of the moving expenses, the rent and fees they were paying for the storage etc. That she still had not forgiven me for how my ex whom I have zero contact with now at this point and she knows this - had physically assaulted her last year. \n",
      "\n",
      "I saw red at this point. I couldn't believe that she was STILL salty about this. I had profusely apologized last year when this had happened. I was a deeply brainwashed and a used and isolated woman with severe mental health issues and I was stuck in an abusive relationship it was HARD for me to get away from H at first. I know that I was wrong now but back then I didn't. I literally couldn't tell what was abusive and what wasn't. After H assaulted my son and me that night several months later against everyone's pleas and advice I started talking to H again because he had not stopped harassing me. And I missed him. Again I KNOW NOW that this was just my abused brain trying to rationalize things. There was another unfortunate incident that took place and in a panic I ended up calling my brother and SIL for help. My brother was at work and couldn't get to me in time. But my SIL rushed to come help me as I was scared for my life and my son's safety. One thing led to another. And SIL called the police and got me safe in her vehicle away from H. I told her NOT to confront H but she couldn't help herself and H and SIL got into a massive argument with SIL getting into his face about how the whole family was going to press charges against him for assaulting me again. And of course because she said these terrible things to H he lost it and put his hands on my SIL.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only problem is that HE DID NOT win that fight. I have known my SIL for 13 years and I never knew the type of violence and rage she was capable of until that night. And I don't think H did either. She soundly handed H's ass to him to the point where she wasn't able to stop stomping him into the parking lot cement and I had to leave the car and get him off of her. By the time police got there H had already hobbled into his truck and fled. SIL and I were questioned and we explained everything. SIL was taken to the hospital for her injuries and i don't recall ever hearing about her getting charged with anything after what happened. I tried reaching out to reconcile with H after this but I think SIL scared him off for good and coupled with not wanting to pay child support this is what caused him to ghost me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that SIL after nearly a year is still stubbornly stewing about what had happened was extremely upset to me. She won the fight. She got what she wanted - H left me and I have not heard from him since. And I now I am a single mother of 2 kids with no income and no support. I snapped and screamed at her that she needed to let go of the past and that it is her duty and my brother's as well to help support me and to help raise their niece and nephew. That they are family and family ALWAYS is supposed to help each other in times of crisis. SIL and my brother were both weirdly calm about everything and monotonously stated that they were tired of me only calling them when I need money (this is not true!!!) and that I don't ever bother asking them simple little things like how they are doing ever. That I can't even shoot them a text. This was a blatant lie as I had JUST texted both of them 2 weeks ago asking how they were and if they were interested in grabbing dinner with me and their nephew. Which mind you they did not respond to.\n",
      "\n",
      "SIL continued to double down and said that due to her mom unexpectedly passing away a few months ago that she was too busy with taking care of her dad and younger siblings who are on the spectrum and are neurodivergent and that financially she was too tied up in her own family's care. And that she also was trying to prioritize her own mental health and wasn't able to help me at the moment. I knew this was a LIE and I confronted her about the life insurance money that her dad got after her mom passed away and told her that I KNOW how generous her dad is and that there is no way he hadn't given her some of that money.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed upset at this and said that the life insurance money her dad had received after her mom's death was already used to pay for debts her parents had and that the remainder had already been placed in a trust for the care of her siblings. And that she had zero interest in that money, would rather \"have her mom back\" and that she was helping her dad financially supplement his income as they have family overseas they provide financial assistance to. Idk what ethnicity SIL is i just know that she and her family come from one of those cultures where they support and send money back overseas all the time like indentured servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "I even pointed this out to her that she is willing  to be a slave to her useless family overseas but can't even be bothered to help support her own SIL and her baby niece and nephew??!! SIL was staring at me like I was crazy and asked me why I thought I was even entitled to the life insurance money or any money her and her dad made. I told her that i am not entitled and am simply asking for HELP. My brother snapped at this and jumped in to defend SIL'S honor or something and shouted at me that I was nothing but an entitled bitch who is simply fucked around and found out and am reaping what I have sown. They both got up to leave and said that they would take in my nephew and care for him because they love him and worry about his safety and would not want him to be homeless. But that me and my daughter were on our own and that they want nothing more to do with us. I know I should not have yelled at them but my emotions were running so high at this point. I have gone through so much these past 2 years and I only keep suffering. I said that they were petty, cheap, and vindictive assholes who were heartless and cruel. They both said that I willingly made my choices and now I had to lay in the bed I made. And left the restaurant. I was embarrassed and crying and to make it worse. I found out before gathering my things that they didn't even have the grace or decency to PAY FOR MY MEAL that I ordered. They knew I was at my favorite restaurant and that I was hungry and needed dinner and still left me with no way to pay when they are well aware of my financial situation. I had to call and beg one of my other friends to pay for me who was not pleased as she is also broke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today my mom is giving me the silent treatment after hearing I'm sure a one sided story of what happened at the restaurant. I even told her that both SIL and brother refused to apply for housing and pay rent for me and the kids until I could get on my feet. And she only said that I was a greedy entitled monster for asking for another grieving family's money. And has not spoke to me since. I just feel so defeated and alone. I have nowhere to go, no way to support myself or my kids, and I am struggling with post partum and so many other mental, emotional, and physical health issues and everyone in my life just keep kicking me while I am down. I have no partner to help me raise my kids. All I need is a leg up and some help to gain some independence again and rely on myself. AITA?\n",
      "\n",
      "So my friend (We're both 24f) recently started dating someone. At first I was really happy for her, she's been single for almost six years after an abusive relationship in high school. But when we were talking about it for the first time I asked some baisc questions about the guy, namely his age, the answer to which shocked me. I asked her his age, and she tells me he's 34.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her that was bad news, for multiple reasons. First off no man goes for someone a decade younger unless he has abusive reasons, he's probably too immature/creepy to get anyone his age, and is instead going for her. I also warned her this was her making the same mistake she made in high school (That relationship also had a large age gap) and she may have issues she needs to figure out in therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She got very upset at me, and said I was getting in her business. I said I was just looking out for her, but she wasn't having it. She said I was finding faults in the guy just because if the age gap (Because that's all I need, why else would he date someone so young) and accused me of being jealous. I'm just trying to help her, but she thinks I'm reading too much into the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I (16F) have this guy (17M) in my class, I'll call him Ethan. Ethan is one of those 'popular' kids who's just an plain A-hole. He has a lot of 'friends', but most of them hate him and only hang out with him so they don't get bullied. He's honestly just such a stereotypical white, privileged  teenage boy. He thinks being homophobic is funny, and everyone who disagrees with him on anything is 'gay'. He always talks down to women and has said in many different ways that he thinks he's better than them. He also bullies all of the coloured people in our year level and tells them to go back to Africa/india and mocks asian people. I was excluded from this (I'm brown) since I'm normally seen as just very tanned, and my mum is white.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm very passionate about discrimination. If someone is being unfairly treated due to their sexuality, gender or race etc. I will not hesitate to stand up for them, but in any other situation I do awful with confrontation. I grew up being biracial, my mum is a lesbian and I have many friends who are apart of the LGBTQI+ community, so when anyone discriminates against those groups I take it very personally.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this started when we were in history, learning about the racial prejudice happening against aboriginal people in Australia. He asked Ethan why the racism against Aboriginal Australians is wrong, and Ethan said something that I can't fully recall about how it's because their black. He said in a derogatory was towards Aboriginal people, and I turned around and asked him to elaborate on that. He went on about how 'if black people don't want people to be racist to them, then they should either not be black or not be in this country' and I went off at him. I didn't shout or anything, I just tried to start calm and explained to him why that's racist and how the things he says actually really impact some people (especially since there were Aboriginal people in our class). I can't remember specifically what I said, but we argued back and forth for a while with the whole class watching.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evantually I said something that he had no response to, and it was clear to everyone that I had won the argument. The only thing he could think to say was 'Whatever you're just a \\*r word\\*' and the teacher immediately sent him out of the classroom. I was pretty proud of myself, and most of my classmates were very happy with the outcome and thanked me. Normally I completely hate being the centre of attention, but it was totally worth it this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "After class I was asked to stay back, and the teacher yelled at me. He said I provoked Ethan, and he was a good kid. I pushed him into a corner and made it so he had nothing else to say apart from calling me a slur. He said that Ethan is entitled to his opinion and I shouldn't go around provoking people and starting fights. I didn't know what to say. I couldn't believe I was getting in trouble for that. I just silently got up and left the classroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day I talked to my year's coordinator and he said that my teacher was right, and I was in the wrong. Myself and many of my peers still think that Ethan was in the wrong, and I shouldn't have gotten into trouble for it. But maybe I'm wrong, AITA?\n",

She does drive us to appointments but so could a taxi.\n",
      "   It all came to a head when I went to say good night to my wife. We sleep in different rooms because of various health issues. 9 o'clock at night and my wife and stepdaughter were sitting on the bed laughing! It was so disrespectful.

      "Hello everyone! So I (38F) have 2 siblings: my older brother Jared (M39) and my younger sister Julie (F34). As an older sibling, I was taught by my brother that it‚Äôs our duty to toughen up the younger siblings and prepare them for the real world, so every day he would put me and Julie through the ‚Äúringer‚Äù as he called it. Eventually as we got older I toughed it out and learned how to deal with it, but Julie was always a little on the softer side so she had a harder timetime accepting realities. This made it harder for us all to get along as we got older because me and Jared could hang out and talk to each other in a way that was fine with us, but we always had to be super sensitive towards baby Julie. Overtime me and Jared just kind of accepted things as they were, because at this point we were all starting to get married and have kids, and we all wanted each other to be involved in each other‚Äôs lives especially for the kids. One day out of the blue however, she decides to tell my parents that she wants nothing to do with them anymore as she claims that she is ‚Äútired of them never having her back when it comes to us‚Äù and having to constantly deal with being talked down to and disrespected, so we are no longer allowed to have a relationship with her or her son Davis (M13). My parents have been devastated for almost a week over this, and personally I‚Äôve been getting pretty tired of seeing them in tears because of Julie‚Äôs obnoxious bullshit, so I decided to do something about it myself.\n",
      "I attempted to contact her through several mediums. After realizing that she had me thoroughly blocked on calls and texts I tried messaging her on Instagram, Facebook, even got desperate enough and went for her Snapchat to no avail. That‚Äôs when I remembered that my nephew is at the age of starting to use social media, so I decided to look him up and see if he had any accounts available that I could contact him through. Surprisingly enough, I actually happen to find him on Facebook with an account that Julie allowed him to create with her supervision. I decided to send him a message telling him to tell my sister to contact me. The response that I received back was not was I was expecting however.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúYou really need to leave my mom alone and learn how to take no for an answer. I‚Äôm not surprised at this point that out of all the people that have cut you off in your life, the two that press you the most are your little sister and her 13-year-old son because it‚Äôs obvious that you can‚Äôt handle when someone younger than you tells you off and sets hard boundaries with you. At this point you‚Äôre an adult and you need to learn to act like one, and the fact that you don‚Äôt act your age is beyond embarrassing. Do not contact me or my mom again.‚Äù\n",
      "Honestly, I was shocked to say the least. I always thought Julie was raising him to be a kind, sweet hearted young boy. After hearing him talk to me like that however, I learned to see him in a much different way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here‚Äôs where I may be TA: after a couple of weeks of no contact, my sister decided to have me come over to her house for a discussion after she got off of work. I was excited for this as I was hoping that we could come to some resolution, and that maybe she would be willing to talk to mom and dad again. Well, it didn‚Äôt go well at all. She told me that she didn‚Äôt appreciate how she‚Äôs always been treated throughout our childhood by me and Jared, and how we‚Äôve always seen ourselves as superior because we are older. The boiling point for her apparently is fact that I couldn‚Äôt leave her alone to the point where I had to ‚Äúharass her son on the internet‚Äù and that is beyond crossing the line in her eyes apparently üôÑ okay.\n",
      "On my way out of the house, I happen to walk past Davis while he was in his room doing some art project. When I did, I was reminded of what he said to me on messenger along with my sister just unloading on me, and something in me snapped, so I confronted him. I grabbed him by the arm and told him: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who you think you are, but in the real world adults don‚Äôt talk to each other that way without getting what‚Äôs coming to them. You wanna talk back to me like you‚Äôre an adult? You‚Äôre going to get treated like one.‚Äù After saying a few more select words to him, I decided to show him myself why it‚Äôs dangerous for kids to mouth off to adults, so I slugged him once in the mouth and once in the stomach before I left. He didn‚Äôt cry or making much of any noise, so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it at the time. \n",
      "Later in the evening as I was preparing for bed however, I heard a knock on my door. At first I thought maybe it was my sister wanting to reconsile, but to my surprise it was the local police. Of course immediately I asked him if they had a warrant, and they didn‚Äôt have one at the time so I asked them to leave. I had a feeling my sister was behind this, so I decided to give her a call. Surprisingly she answered the call, but only for me to her screaming at me at the top of her lungs, which to be honest immediately pissed me right off. Before she could even get into it because I knew what she was going to say, I told her something along the lines of:‚ÄúGuarantee you raise your son right and the world wont have to do it for you.‚Äù and hung up. As much as I‚Äôve been getting upset with her obnoxious bullshit lately, I really can‚Äôt help but wonder if she does have a legitimate point somewhere in all this.\n",

      "I (F) am currently in a secret fwb relationship with a guy that I met around 2 months ago. We promised to keep everything a secret and still stay friends even after our little fwb thing is over. It was going great until I met his \"bf\" whom we'll call Nic. When I first met Nic we got along very well, talking to each other all the time until I noticed that my fwb started to get a little irritated almost when me and Nic are hanging out and started reminding me more often to not tell a single tidbit of information about our relationship with anyone. Then one day he fessed up and said that he was in a \"mutual relationship\" with Nic. He does feel a little guilty about it (Note he does acknowledge it as cheating and is fine with it) and thought I was gonna hate him for it but since I easily get swayed by people who are closer to me and I was still very horny so I said to him that \"I'm fine with it\", so we continued to do our usual meetups. I decided to do a little digging into their relationship to see if it was true or not so I followed Nic's social media accounts and on his TikTok I found several photos of them cuddling with each other closely. I also observed them at a party/when hanging out and Nic always followed my fwb like a puppy while my fwb seemed to take more interest in me. At the same time, I noticed me and Nic drifting apart day by day, him texting me less and now it's to the point where he only snaps at me once a day for our streak. This could be him noticing that I'm getting a little bit too close with my fwb since he almost caught us hugging closely once. Now, the reasons why I decided not to tell Nic about this is first, because of my fwb. He can get quite aggressive sometimes and also he's going through a lot right now, especially with his family and I don't want to ruin his life any further, but I'm also starting to feel like I'm being an ass to Nic because he is also going through a lot as well, (seeming to have a lot of discrimination in the past due to his girly outlook despite being a guy, and I relate to that being a tomboy) he has a longer and stronger bond with my fwb and he seems to like him a lot so this could possibly hurt him a lot. I also want to keep a good relationship with my fwb because I'm still quite horny all the time and he's entertaining to have around. The last reason is that I am still fairly young and stuff like this could get me into a lot of trouble socially and futuristically if word gets out about it. Currently, I am just waiting for events to unfold, continuing to be dirty with my fwb. So AITAH?\n",

      "I 39F have been with my 40M for ten years now, we have two kids together in primary school and he has an older son in college. I was always wanted to get married but he has always refused saying he doesn‚Äôt believe in it. We have had many arguments about this and I ended up saying that if he did want to get married then he should have a will in case something happened to him that the kids and myself would be taken care of. He pushed back on this as well saying that I just wanted him to die, for me asking to be looked after if something happens is not an outrageous ask. He is the primary bread winner at this time, but in the past I had been the one to support the family 100% financially and take care of everything at home, now I work less but still contribute to the family, I pay for some trips and after school activities for the kids and have taken care of my personal expenses, he takes care of the household expenses. He finally agreed to go make the will and was so angry about it, we went together to go have it written up, I remember being the universal beneficiary. Now fast forward almost a year and I am asking to have a copy of the will to have at the house as it is an important document, this again caused a huge fight, but in this fight he said that I and our 2 kids were to receive 65% and his son was to receive the other 35%. Now this made me very upset because it feels like me and children are being valued as less than his son. He doesn‚Äôt see a problem with this and asked how much am I supposed to love my son? And I asked well how much are you supposed to love me and your other two kids?  AITAH for being upset?\n",

Over a year we fell in love, and I proposed to her before I went on my next assignment in the Middle East. I understand getting engaged to a woman overseas after only a year is dumb, but I am in love with her, and I thought we were different. I was told multiple times by friends that, most likely she was just with me for citizenship as her country is not the best. Still, I ignored them as we had multiple conversations about trust, and if we ever wanted to end the relationship to just let the other know so we wouldn‚Äôt have any harsh feelings. \n",

These faces were faces of someone receiving head, and her hands continued to move weirdly down near her vagina. When I was about to pick up the phone she immediately hung up and when I called back she said it was an accident and also I thought I heard her door closing. I tried not to jump to conclusions and give her the benefit of the doubt and asked if she was playing with herself. She said no and laughed at me, but then I asked her why what were the faces she was making and she kept on laughing at me and joking until I told her I was serious. She stated that she does not know what I am talking about. I told her give me an explanation about what happened, but she said to come to where she is and find my explanation for myself. She is mad at me and does not want to speak about it again. I apologized and explained it would be a weird and crazy story for me just to make up. I want to say I am being insecure and crazy and just move on, but at this point, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I hope the comments tell me I was the AH and to move on, but I was always told follow my gut. AITAH\n",

      "So let me preface this, I‚Äôve had issues with my self image since I was young. It was especially hard for me in high school, the friends I had were kinda judgmental. I also had a basic fashion sense. I wore skinny jeans, graphic tees, crop tops, sweaters. However, I really admired gothic fashion ever since I was little, but at the time, I never had the courage (nor the money) to dress that way.\n",

      "We got into another argument ab my clothes, and I asked him why he puts me down. He said it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt include him and that I‚Äôm alienating him/leaving him behind. But the thing is, I thought I have been including him. Like I mentioned before, I would show him new clothes I get or the outfits I planned on wearing to our dates. \n",

      "I then offered to send him pictures of my outfits before going out if I were alone (we don‚Äôt live together). He said no to the offer, and said he didn‚Äôt know exactly how he wants to be included, he said he just wants to be. He‚Äôs expecting me to figure out how to do that, but I don‚Äôt know how else to include him since he‚Äôs turned down my offers. I don‚Äôt want him to shame me anymore bc it hurts my feelings.\n",

In the night, we decided to watch another movie in my room where my sister slept and we started fucking right beside her while she slept and we were interrupted by my mom while i was inside her (thank god she didnt turn on the lights) we quickly did the deed and then went on to sleep in different rooms..

She said she wanted a mental health break and hired someone to manage and further grow her company. Right now, she went to live in a very millennial neighborhood ( mostly college students).

But the reality is that she devotes a huge amount of time to this and it now has obligation energy. She's on a weird whimsical phase and has gone on a county fair/ carnival kick. We had an argument last week because she's avoiding any type of business related conversation. Also, she took off for the entire weekend and went to one of those fairs with concerts and stuff. We talked last night when she gave me a t-shirt that she got me.Honestky, the gift feels like a breadcrumb. We had another argument when I pointed out that her need for the circus and the carnivals is like living in a fantasy. She blew up at me, called me names, and called me an energy vampire and that my insistence is interfering with her mental health. She also says that she can't even eat in peace because I‚Äôm always talking about what I‚Äôm gonna get from her and that she's done. She snatched the shirt from my hands and asked me to leave. I told her that she hasn't been a good gf, since my exes have had much less than she does and at least they were interested in seeing me grow. She says she doesn‚Äôt care but she looked really hurt.

She'd only worked background roles and done commercials by that point but she was pretty much guaranteed a role in what ended up becoming a really big movie.

      "The actress that replaced her was a bit younger and hasn't really done anything since then (I've looked on imdb) and my mom's gone on about how she would've been in this movie or that movie.

And then she said she wishes she'd taken that role because then she'd be able to talk about how pointless the strike was and that made me feel really bad because then she wouldn't have had me.

I feel really bad about it because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm cheating on my girlfriends (20F), and it‚Äôs been hard to control my starchy urges lately. I wake up and go to the kitchen and stare at the cornstarch container, contemplating whether or not I should try it irl. Until a week ago, these thoughts were just thoughts. I tried my best to keep it in, but I woke up, irrepressibly horny and desperate, and did something I now so deeply regret. It was early in the morning and I was exhausted afterwards, so I said I‚Äôd clean it up later and went back to bed. I didn‚Äôt want to think about what I did so I kept putting it off, until yesterday. My girlfriend made some gravy for a family dinner with her parents, and went to get the cornstarch. My liquids seemed to harden the cornstarch around the edges and make a phallic mold in the container. Needless to say, she was furious. She screamed at me, asking why I put my dick in the cornstarch while I futilely tried to explain my conundrum. She said she‚Äôs extremely disappointed in me and feels like she may have to break up, and I feel like the asshole for having ruined my relationship over cornstarch.

      "\n",
      "On this discord server we were both on, he had a friend who I used to text. Let‚Äôs call this friend Luke. Luke and I used to flirt online too, at some point we exchanged nudes. Mike heard about it, then asked me if it was true. I lied and I said no. \n",
      "Later on in our relationship, evidence came out that it was true from Luke himself, so I ended up being forced to tell him what happened. He agreed to giving me a second chance and this made me change big time. I started doing everything right, I fully changed, and I gave him more than I‚Äôve seen anyone give someone in a relationship. Obviously, he deserved it, I thought he was amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, we‚Äôve been having issues. He hasn‚Äôt been the same. He took a step back and completely switched up. I was really confused to why this happened, and when I asked him, he basically told me that he‚Äôs tired of this long distance relationship. He said that there is only so much he can do and give when he doesn‚Äôt even know how I am personally. I understood, but this was supposed to be something he considered before we talked for 6 months. Again, I didn‚Äôt expect anything from him. I didn‚Äôt want him to do half of the things I did for him, I just needed some verbal reassurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few weeks of that happened, I told him we should stop talking till I am able to fly out and actually meet him. I told my best friend this. That is where everything went wrong. My friend, let‚Äôs call her sarah, knows almost everything about me. We‚Äôve been friends for three years and we went to the same highschool. I introduced her to my boyfriend at the time we were talking, she immediately expressed how sweet, funny, and attractive she found him, this I found odd. Sarah has had a past with flirting with guys I‚Äôm interested in, she even let my ex choke her at a party right in front of my face. \n",
      "\n",
      "She took it upon her to text and call him, asking him what‚Äôs wrong because she wanted to ‚Äúhear his side‚Äù of the story. Eventually, she ‚Äúslipped out‚Äù and told him every thing about my romantic/sexual history down to the dot. I mean, she brought things up from 2021 that even I forgot about. She sent him screenshots, gave him names and their profiles, and explained everything to him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now I understand that me lying to him about my sexual history is wrong, and that no excuse will ever justify it, but I will explain my reasoning now: he is the type of guy that cares about what a girl does. I didn‚Äôt want him to lose interest, or think that I am some sort of whore. The thing is, I didn‚Äôt even do that much, most of what I did was all with the same guy and I haven‚Äôt done anything in almost a year. Again, that doesn‚Äôt excuse what I did but this is just my reasoning towards why I lied. I never meant to hurt him, or anyone matter of fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now what I‚Äôm confused about, is why did she call him behind my back and snake me out like that? She lied to me telling me that she was trying to cover it up for me, but in reality, she was texting him everything I was telling her to tell him. She kept saying there is no point in me trying to save it, he‚Äôs already done. She twisted many things from the past, making it sound worse; she took my trust and completely tore it down. My faults are my own, but she can‚Äôt be the judge of that and give herself authority to my own relationships. If he was to find out from me, or from anywhere else and not my best friend of three years, this situation wouldn‚Äôt have been the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Mike ended up calling me, yelling at me, calling me names such as a ‚Äúlying whore‚Äù ‚Äúa slut‚Äù and ‚Äúyou are so fucked in the end.‚Äù I understand that I shouldn‚Äôt have lied to him, but is this really 100% my fault? I was thinking of how I would react if I found out he lied to me about his body count, and I would have never ended the relationship and blocked him on every platform that I had him on, but at the same time, I shouldn‚Äôt compare. Was Sarah in the right? Was I at fault? Has this situation been blown out of proportion?\n",

I value this friendship a lot AND given the nature of our relationships, feel like it wouldn't be a huge deal?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: because someone said I was waiting around like a vulture, I want to clarify. I have never crossed the line and would have never considered this until she was very honest with me about her intentions. I realized I was interested and immediately asked my partner. Looking back, she had flirted more extensively and was very open about being bisexual and he was very comfortable with her attraction to women. I'm very open with my sexuality as well and I don't think it's problematic at all for two adults in open relationships to express this purely sexual intention. I've just never been in this situation before and really don't want to fuck things up with my best friend and would be okay turning this down if I'm being completely naive.\n",

We also slept with each other sporadically over the 6 months we were broken up. When we were broken up he was sleeping with two other people afaik. One was a girl he told me not to worry about who he was friends with, and one was a girl he worked with.

He asked what she was doing and she just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm laying‚Äù. After about 20 seconds she sits up and looks at me and my bf. She out of nowhere says to him ‚Äúso are we gonna fuck anytime soon or not?‚Äù. I‚Äôm stunned and don‚Äôt say anything, and my bf says ‚ÄúI have a girlfriend‚Äù. She looks at me and says to him ‚Äúoh so you ARE back with your ex then?‚Äù and he said yeah. She doesn‚Äôt say anything for like 10 seconds and just stares at us. I‚Äôm about to ask who the fuck she is when she just blurts out some rant about how she‚Äôs sorry she messed things up between them and she still thinks about him a lot, then she just gets up and stumbles off before he can even reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "I finally ask my boyfriend who the fuck she was and he just said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs Emily‚Äù. I ask him who she is and how he knows her, and he tells me a story of how they met in the bar we were in, and made out a little the night they met and he got her number. They texted for a week and had a date planned. But she apparently turned up to the date wasted, to the point she actually fell over, and my boyfriend told her to just leave because he didn‚Äôt wanna deal with that, and she at first begged him to just go home with her and she would fuck him and he said no and this lead her to have a mini melt down and she ended up storming off. She apologised the next day and he said it was fine but never spoke to her again as he said she seemed like she had issues. This made sense as the girl seemed fuckin bizarre.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This did however upset me because I was under the impression he was only seeing two girls and I felt like he had kept this from me. He said he didn‚Äôt tell me about it because it didn‚Äôt seem important, and that he only told me about the people he slept with regularly. I told him it was super important, and he said ‚Äúoh‚Äù with a worried look. I asked him how many girls he actually dated, and he said ‚Äúdefine dated‚Äù which sent alarm bells ringing. So I just asked how many girls he made out with and he told me he didn‚Äôt know. I was shocked by this and asked him what he meant and he said he would go out to clubs and end up sometimes making out with 4/5 girls in a SINGLE night, and he had no way to know how many girls he‚Äôd kissed. I asked him how many girls he actually went on a date with and he thought for a minute and told me 16. SIXTEEN. In 6 months. Of this 16 he had slept with 9 of them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now this DOES include the 2 girls I already knew about, so it‚Äôs 7 women he slept with and didn‚Äôt tell me about. Might I add he was still sleeping with me in this period. I asked why he didn‚Äôt tell me, and he pointed out I explicitly said I didn‚Äôt wanna know what he was up to, and when I finally asked if he was seeing anyone else he only mentioned the people he was seeing at that moment. I asked why he didn‚Äôt tell me once we had been together and he again pointed out I explicitly said I didn‚Äôt wanna go into detail about our time apart, and that most of the flings fizzled out with the other girls after they realised he wouldn‚Äôt commit, so the women he didn‚Äôt mention he wasn‚Äôt seeing for longer then a week or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm still upset. On the one hand I feel misled about what he was up to, and I feel upset that he had to try THAT MANY other options before coming back to me. On the other hand I did make it clear I didn‚Äôt really wanna know what he was up to. AITAH?\n",

      "For context, this happened back in early 2019 before Covid. I was 25 f and my husband was 26 m. We came from wealthy families, and we're both making a decent amount of money from our jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he proposed back in January 2017, we both decided to pay for our own dream wedding (in our culture, its usually the parents who pays but its not mandatory), so we decided to have a nearly 3 years long engagement so that we can save enough money for both our dream grand wedding and our honeymoon (we both were excited to go to Taiwan for an ultimate Night Market food trip! I just wanted to eat everything after being on a diet to fit into my wedding princess ballgown). \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first things I did was ask my best girls to be my bridesmaids. I asked each of them personally, even had gifts (a cute wallet, chocolates, hairbrush, a tote bag and a \"will you be my bridesmaid?\" card). \n",
      "\n",
      "I made it clear to each of them before they accepted that they will be paying for their own bridesmaid gown but not the full price, I will be paying for 40% and they will only have to pay for the remaining 60%. I told them if they are uncomfortable with this, I will not be angry or offended and I understand why they can't accept the role. The gown will be custom-made and they will definitely get to keep it. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of them accepted. I had 9 bridesmaids in total. Yes I know it was alot, I realise that now but back then, I just couldn't narrow it down. Hahaha. \n",
      "\n",
      "So everything was going great. I had them sent all their measurements so that I could start getting the gowns made. Then one day I sent a message in our Group Chat to remind them that since the wedding date was drawing near, I'd have to receive the payment for the gowns soon. Almost all of them paid on that same day except this one girl. Let's call her Bianca...\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied with a \"Oh I didn't know we had to pay ü§î....\" so I reminded her that when I first asked her, I did tell her then, and she said I never mentioned it to her. All the other 8 girls said I did, but only she said I didn't. But I know I did. I even remembered when and where I asked her. \n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to private message her, trying to solve this since the gown was already made. She outright told me that she won't be paying for it because she has been a bridesmaids many times and never had she ever paid for a gown. I told her that this wedding isn't paid by our parents but out of our own pockets, unlike her other friends whose weddings were all paid by their parents. She proceeded to tell me that her 'dad told her to back out cause he didn't approve of her to pay for the gown'. She also said she didn't have enough money, and that she will back out because I never mentioned to her that she needs to pay. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mind you, she was in her 20s and working a stable job and still living with her parents so she doesn't have any bills to pay except her Netflix account. She also bought herself an LV bag a few weeks after this scenario. No money, my ass Bianca. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was pissed and hurt because we have been friends since we were in diapers. Our families are close. Our moms were pregnant at the same time. My family had always been generous to hers. We got them expensive gifts and wines, paid the tab when we all went out together. Bought them lots of souvenirs when we travel. It was at this moment, I realise that her family never really paid for anything. During potluck gatherings, they'd come empty handed but pack some food home and drank all the alcohol. They never offered to pay for anything. During occasions like Chinese New Year or Christmas, they'll be the only family that doesn't give any red packets to the kids or presents for anyone. They were freeloaders. \n",
      "\n",
      "But they had money. They were not poor. They even have a sports car and a huge home. \n",
      "\n",
      "After I came to this realisation, I knew Bianca never planned to help pay. She was hoping for more freebies and that I'd let it slide and pay for her. \n",
      "\n",
      "So after she left the Group Chat, I had a talk with my fiance about it then he told me to return all the money back to my bridesmaids and he will cover the full cost of the gown. He wants Bianca to know that we decided to pay for the gowns after she backed out. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I told my girls about it, but what they told me literally made me cry. They all refused their money back. And my maid of honor told me \"the measure of true friendship is not in the amount of money paid but in the moments when we are there for each other\". I ugly cried. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was still feeling angry and petty, and wanted some kind of revenge on Bianca and also reward my bridesmaids for being amazing girlfriends. So I decided to bring my girls to an all expense paid trip to a Beach Resort.  And this was no ordinary resort. It was Club Med. Free flow of food, alcohol and entertainment. And I made sure that Bianca knew about it through Instagram. We had the most amazing time and definitely strengthen our friendship more there. It was a core memory weekend. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bianca was not happy. She came to me after the trip and asked me why I never mentioned this trip to her when I first asked her to be her bridesmaids. I told her I did some gardening and plucked out some weeds, and I was so happy with the results that I decided to celebrate. She got mad at me, called me rude and a bitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did still attend my wedding though and even had the audacity to tell guests she backed out because I wanted to pay for everyone's gown except hers, painting herself as the victim. My mildly drunk dad overheard and shut her down immediately, embarrassing her in front of many people.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has not spoken to me since then. \n",
      "\n",
      "I barely see her anymore. Last I heard, she got married, had a baby, got divorced cause her husband had a gambling problem and she moved back in with her parents and is a single mom now. \n",
      "\n",
      "Was I an asshole for wanting to pay for everything after she backed out? I know I acted out of spite. I started feeling a little guilty and felt like I may have overreacted...but part of me is still happy that I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: alot of people are judging me because I asked my bridesmaids to pay for the gown. Where I'm from, bridesmaids paying for gowns are a norm. So I hope you all can look at that with an open mind. Also, to clarify, my husband is the one who paid for the trip, not me. And I did what I did not because she doesn't want to pay or because she backed out last minute, but because she she lied to me by saying that I never told her about paying beforehand, and mainly because I've realise that she has been using me for years for money. I have been paying for her almost every time we went out together, and not once has she paid anything for me, and the one time I asked for it, she said no. It hurt because she was one of my closest friends, and we have known each other since our diaper days. If that means I'm self centred and entitled, then okay. I accept that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the trip was not solely to spite her. When my husband suggested it, I was excited to tell my girls. The revenge on her was just a bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      " I (21M) accused my partner (21F) of three years of being a changeling! I told her that she must‚Äôve been a fairy who had switched places with my partner and was now posing as her. You see I recently have been taking a Changlings and Fairies class for fun. \n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm not really one to believe in magic or supernatural things and I honestly felt like some of the tales we read in class were just that‚Äì tales. That is until I started to notice how much my partner shares traits with the fairies and changelings we talked about in class. \n",
      "\n",
      "It started out with small things, like how I noticed her eyes are kind of multi-colored. Sometimes they‚Äôre brown, other times grey, and then occasionally green. But maybe I just hadn‚Äôt noticed until now, and because they never turned a strange color like lavender I didn‚Äôt question it. She also seemed to grow a couple of inches taller than me when before we were both of the same height, and her fingers were slightly longer than mine. But again I brushed past it thinking it was just some late changes happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that it‚Äôs spring allergies are all around, but my partner never suffered from them‚Ä¶ until now. She has recently arrived home many times with a runny nose and puffy eyes after coming from class. I asked her what happened and she mentioned that it felt like allergies. One day I walked with her and noticed that she walked past a HUGE batch of St. John Wort which are dangerous to fairies. At this point, I was unnerved but again decided it must be a weird coincidence, sometimes allergies don‚Äôt show up until you are much older.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then about three weeks ago I bought this weird little wooden statue that I‚Äôve placed in the middle of our dining table. Since then my partner refuses to eat there, saying something is making her stomach hurt to the point that she gets sick and has to lay in bed for hours. Later I was scrolling through my ordered items and when I clicked on the wooden statue in the description it said it was made of ROWAN WOOD! Yet another thing we learned in class was bad for fairies. By now it was starting to feel less like coincidences and more like my partner was a fairy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I started to pay attention to some of her behaviors and realized that she does not touch iron and that she tries really hard to avoid touching anything that has iron in it by using a napkin or towel. And when she thinks she is alone she pulls out a flute from her drawers - I didn‚Äôt even know she bought a flute- and she‚Äôs really good at it too. In all the years I‚Äôve known her, I‚Äôve never seen her touch an instrument!  \n",
      "\n",
      "And the most incriminating thing is that she went on a trip to Ireland with her family to visit relatives over winter break. She was there for a bit and she texted me to tell me that she was visiting a fairy circle that her grandmother said was where she helped referee fairies in a game. When I was over with her family for dinner one night, her brother asked me if my partner had told me about the night she got lost and didn‚Äôt arrive home til like midnight. Apparently, she had gotten lost and some strange man had walked her home, but according to her brother, he never saw a man with her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once I heard this story all the dots started connecting and I was sure my partner had been kidnapped by fairies and changed with an imposter! And I needed to confront her to find out where my partner was. When I confronted her she laughed thinking I was joking, but when she saw that I was serious she got super angry with me and told me that my class was getting to my head. I listed all the facts out to her and she only got more pressed and tried to rebuttal each of my facts with explanations like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a late bloomer‚Äù, ‚ÄúAllergies are weird‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt sleep at night so I was out for a walk!‚Äù When I didn‚Äôt budge she got up, grabbed her stuff and left! She didn‚Äôt come home and later her brother texted me that she had gone to his place. \n",
      "\n",
      "This all happened last night and now I feel like maybe the class was getting to my head and I might just have gone crazy thinking my girlfriend was a changeling, but still something inside me is still unsure. So tell me, am I the asshole? Am I crazy? Is my girlfriend really my girlfriend? What should I do?\n",

She blew up at me and began to call me disgusting and threatening to leave and block me for ‚Äòblaming someone for going somewhere.‚Äô I reiterated that the person who commits the crime is completely at fault, however the girl/person who puts themself in that situation should have been more responsible. \n",

      "so last night at my older sister house(i live in 3 different places mostly at my older sister's place occasionally at parent's house and rarely at my small apartment)i decided to talk to my older sister into helping my little sister she said she doesn't have any money i told her maybe we could lend her some alimony money.she told me not to do anything with that money without her permission and its strictly for abroad education i asked if could sell my car since im not going to be staying here then she got mad at me asked me if my mom put me up for this and disgusted for the fact im picking their side over her that we should stick together against them.then told me she has D.A bills(some paycheck govt employees receive every 1-2 years) due that she will see about it once she gets them but not sure(i should have stopped right there).i asked her to promise me that she will to that she replied \"no but you can forget about your abroad education and give me back things i bought for you and go support your little sister i will go study myself instead\". i quickly apologized her she told me to never talk about it ever again.\n",

      "So i know the title sounds bad but hear me out. Back when i was in school i had just started a new school and had no friends. I‚Äôll save you from the entire back story but i got into a friend group with  a couple of girls. Well one of these girls, who we will call Lori , was so annoying and was a rat. I think we just added her to the friend group because we felt bad for her. Loris family was moderately wealthy so keep that in mind . honestly didn‚Äôt like her but i went over her house once with another  girl and when i went to the bathroom her mom pulled me aside and long story short told me that her daughter didn‚Äôt have a lot of friends and no one liked her. i didn‚Äôt know where this was going because who would say those things about  their own daughter? She told that she would pay me 100 dollars a month if i stayed friends with Lori, and 300 dollars everytime we hung out. Now i have morals and i first i hesitated. But you have to understand my situation, i didn‚Äôt have a lot of nice things and i was a broke teenager. I thought that i would just try it out for a month then call it off because i didn‚Äôt want lori to get too attached to me because i was awesome. So i accepted because what was the worst that could happen? I decided to take that offer because it was just a silly little friendship. But money changes people and i could afford almost anything and i was basically rich and it was just too good. So i decided to let it go on a little longer. But over the span of a couple months i started to get closer with Lori. Well she got closer with me but i never really liked her. I was just so cool so how could she not resist being my friend. I was just a really good actress and was really good at making her think i was her friend. One day i made a joke that her mom was paying me to be her friend and that‚Äôs when she said ‚Äúwell she has done it before‚Äù. And i felt really bad because i realized i was just another friend being paid off. honestly she deserved it cuz she was annoying. But i had to remember my goal of all that money. Everything was going great and lori didn‚Äôt suspect a thing, but one month Loris mom forgot to pay me. I was confused and spoke to her mom over text when she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you need the money anymore because you look like you guys are actually friends‚Äù um no no no babe you got it ALL WRONG. I was fuming mad so i told her i still want money because her daughter is the human version of a headache. She told me no so i decided it was over. The next day i unfriended Lori but i never told her about her mom. This was a while ago when i was still young but i don‚Äôt think i did anything wrong. i told some friends about it years later and they told me that it was wrong and i should tell Lori about what her mom did all those years ago and i don‚Äôt want to. So what do you think AITA?\n",

      "I am f 23 and my fourth cousin (who I will be calling my finance) is m 25. So lets start from the beginning so when I was six my mom and my dad got divorced and we moved from Kentucky to Texas so I have never met boyfriend before. My mom met a new guy at work and he had family who lived in Kentucky. My grandfather sadly passed away so my family was a little crazy since he held our family together. So my mom, her boyfriend, and me all moved back to Kentucky to see our family. When we moved back all our family was there even my finance he was in the corner playing on his phone he was hot and hunky and sexy so I made the first move and went to talk him. We started talking days on days then turned into mouths then on Christmas my whole family had a party and my finance was there me him talked and then we toke it the bedroom which is my moms old room since it was at my grandmas house things got steamy and turned into sex then when he finished we got up and fixed our hair and left. Nobody knew so it was good but then about three months later I found out I was pregnant. Me and my finance were so happy but he said he didn‚Äôt want anyone to know so for until I was six months I kept it a secret until a family reunion I was talking to his mom and said ‚ÄúI am pregnant with your sons baby!‚Äù Saying made her slap me then tried to fight me but I got away my mom was very mad at me and kicked me out and so did my aunt to my finance. Everybody in my family was pissed. I had beautiful baby girl with my finance standing right next to me. Later that month my finance proposed. Then my aunt called trying to see her granddaughter but I said no since she was unsupportive and tried to fight because I was pregnant. No my family is trying to get me to let everyone see my daughter but I don‚Äôt care. Know I pregnant again with a handsome baby boy and living with my finance\n",

I asked her why she couldn‚Äôt, and she said her brother didn‚Äôt like when she wore provocative clothing so she mostly wears sweaters and such. I thought that was extremely fucked up and it made me super mad. I drove her back home (as I usually do after our sessions) and told her I wanted to talk with her brother. He came over and I told him I wanted to have a chat, and then told him it‚Äôs super fucked up he polices what his younger sister wears and why the hell does he think it‚Äôs appropriate to control what she wears. He stopped for a moment and then asked if we could step outside, and so we went outside and he told me that he doesn‚Äôt tell her how to dress. He proceeded to explain that he was raped a few years ago and it made him anxious whenever his sister wore anything revealing because he was absolutely terrified of something bad happening to her (even though he didn‚Äôt say anything about it) and his sister really doesn‚Äôt want him to get so worried/anxious over it so she doesn‚Äôt wear anything revealing.

One let's me listening on the surroundings. One lets me text her through the app. The reason I'm so overprotective over her is because she got pregnant at 14 by a  20 year old she was raped at the age of eight and the reason she lives with us was because she was sexually abused by her mother. She also did 28-year-old at 14. She did drugs and alcohol before the age of 13.

She works part time and takes care of my brother (car accident, partially temporarily paralyzed). They are waiting for insurance to kick in to pay for his medical bills, an on call nurse and PT. Since she moved to part time and is hard up with money, she offered to babysit my daughter (11) for extra cash. I offered to give her $250 a week, day care prices. She agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, since I know they have been going to food banks, I have been providing my daughter food every day I send her there so my SIL doesn't have to worry about it. Usually a couple sandwiches and snacks. However, I get a text from my daughter yesterday saying my SIL humiliated her and made her feel stupid over taking food. I guess my daughter was still hungry after eating all the food I packed (she just had a ADHD med change and I guess it peaked her appetite) and she went inside and ended up eating a bunch of food and my SIL lost it because it was \"all they had\" (they were having a pool party so everyone was outside and didn't see her take the food). Told my daughter to get outside. So I immediately leave work and come to investigate and find my SIL inside with her head in her hands. I ask what happened and she wouldn't even look at me. I start prying for an answer because my daughter is visibly upset and practically ran to the car when I got there. She snaps and says \"go ask you kid how much she fucking ate Chrissy, AFTER I told her not to touch what little food I had. Go!\" So I told her no, you tell me, you're the fucking adult. Well, she literally dumped out an entire full size packing box of empty containers. Cracker packs, like 4 fruit containers (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and watermelon), pudding cups, bags of chips and an empty sandwich meat bag. It was a lot and I'm not saying it wasn't. But then she goes \"want to see what I have left to feed my fucking family?\" Opens her fridge and it was basically bare. Now, in no way am I condoning it because that was absolutely a lot of food but I still think it's fucked up that she made my daughter feel like shit about it. I told her my kid wouldn't be going back there at all and she said \"good. Your kid just knowingly took at least 3 fucking days worth of food from my kids mouths so I'd rather not see her anyways.\" My mom says I'm an AH because I knew my kid has a big appetite and didn't pack more food for her, which apparently makes this my fault and says that I should offer to buy them groceries, which I won't do. I guess she went grocery shopping for them following this.\n",
